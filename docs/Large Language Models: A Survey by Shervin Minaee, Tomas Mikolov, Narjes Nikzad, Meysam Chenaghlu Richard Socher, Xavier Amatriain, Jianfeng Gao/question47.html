   <h2>
    47,Is data sparsity a significant challenge in training early language models?,True,False,
   </h2>
   <p>
    The correct answer is:
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     True
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Data sparsity
    </strong>
    was a
    <strong>
     significant challenge
    </strong>
    in training
    <strong>
     early language models
    </strong>
    because:
   </p>
   <p>
    1.
    <strong>
     Limited training data
    </strong>
    – Early models lacked
    <strong>
     large-scale datasets
    </strong>
    , making it difficult to generalize.
   </p>
   <p>
    2.
    <strong>
     Rare word problem
    </strong>
    – Words with
    <strong>
     low occurrence
    </strong>
    in training data were
    <strong>
     poorly represented
    </strong>
    , leading to
    <strong>
     low-quality predictions
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    3.
    <strong>
     N-gram models struggled
    </strong>
    – Traditional
    <strong>
     n-gram models
    </strong>
    couldn't effectively capture long-range dependencies due to
    <strong>
     sparse co-occurrences
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    4.
    <strong>
     Neural networks helped mitigate this
    </strong>
    – Techniques like
    <strong>
     word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) and transformers
    </strong>
    improved the representation of
    <strong>
     rare words
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
     contextual understanding
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Modern LLMs address data sparsity by leveraging
    <strong>
     massive pre-training datasets
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
     context-aware embeddings
    </strong>
    .
