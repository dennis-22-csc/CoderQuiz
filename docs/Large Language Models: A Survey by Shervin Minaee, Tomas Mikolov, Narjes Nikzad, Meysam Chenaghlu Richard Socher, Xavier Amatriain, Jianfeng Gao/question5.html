    5,What is a common technique to address data sparsity in language models?,Smoothing,Regularization,Normalization,All of the above
   </h2>
   <p>
    The correct answer is:
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Smoothing
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Smoothing techniques help address
    <strong>
     data sparsity
    </strong>
    by adjusting probability distributions to account for unseen words or n-grams. Common methods include
    <strong>
     Laplace smoothing
    </strong>
    ,
    <strong>
     Add-k smoothing
    </strong>
    , and
    <strong>
     Backoff and Interpolation
    </strong>
    in language modeling.
   </p>
   <p>
    While
    <strong>
     regularization
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
     normalization
    </strong>
    are useful in machine learning, they primarily help with overfitting and training stability rather than directly handling data sparsity.
