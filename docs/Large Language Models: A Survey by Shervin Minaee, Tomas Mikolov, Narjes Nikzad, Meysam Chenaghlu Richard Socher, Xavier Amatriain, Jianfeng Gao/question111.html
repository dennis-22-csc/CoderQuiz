   <p>
    The correct answer is:
   </p>
   <p>
    ✅
    <strong>
     To represent words in continuous space
    </strong>
   </p>
   <h3>
    <strong>
     Explanation:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    Embeddings are
    <strong>
     dense vector representations
    </strong>
    of words, phrases, or sentences in a continuous space. Instead of using
    <strong>
     one-hot encoding
    </strong>
    (which is sparse and high-dimensional), embeddings
    <strong>
     capture semantic relationships
    </strong>
    between words by placing similar words closer together in a multi-dimensional space.
   </p>
   <h4>
    <strong>
     Why are embeddings important?
    </strong>
   </h4>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     They capture meaning
    </strong>
    – Similar words (e.g., "king" and "queen") have similar vector representations.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     They handle synonyms better
    </strong>
    – Unlike one-hot encoding, embeddings recognize words with similar meanings.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     They reduce sparsity
    </strong>
    – Since they are low-dimensional, embeddings avoid the sparsity issue seen in traditional word representations.
   </p>
   <h4>
    <strong>
     Why not the other options?
    </strong>
   </h4>
   <p>
    ❌
    <strong>
     To map words into fixed probabilities
    </strong>
    – Embeddings
    <strong>
     do not assign probabilities
    </strong>
    ; they provide vector representations instead.
   </p>
   <p>
    ❌
    <strong>
     To reduce dimensionality
    </strong>
    – While embeddings often use
    <strong>
     lower-dimensional representations
    </strong>
    , their primary purpose is
    <strong>
     capturing relationships between words
    </strong>
    , not just reducing dimensions.
   </p>
   <p>
    ❌
    <strong>
     To improve grammar checking
    </strong>
    – Grammar checking may use embeddings indirectly, but embeddings
    <strong>
     primarily represent words
    </strong>
    in a way that captures meaning and context.
