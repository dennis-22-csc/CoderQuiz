   <h2>
    41,Is "in-context learning" a characteristic of only smaller LLMs?,False,True,
   </h2>
   <p>
    The correct answer is:
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     False
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     In-context learning
    </strong>
    is
    <strong>
     not limited to smaller LLMs
    </strong>
    —it is actually a key feature of
    <strong>
     larger LLMs
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    1.
    <strong>
     Larger models demonstrate stronger in-context learning
    </strong>
    – They can
    <strong>
     generalize
    </strong>
    from examples in the prompt
    <strong>
     without additional training
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    2.
    <strong>
     Smaller models have limited in-context learning
    </strong>
    – They may struggle to understand
    <strong>
     complex patterns
    </strong>
    from just a few examples.
   </p>
   <p>
    3.
    <strong>
     Scaling laws show improved performance
    </strong>
    – Bigger models tend to
    <strong>
     learn more effectively
    </strong>
    from context due to their increased capacity.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus,
    <strong>
     in-context learning is more prominent in larger LLMs
    </strong>
    like
    <strong>
     GPT-4, PaLM, and LLaMA 2
    </strong>
    rather than smaller ones.
