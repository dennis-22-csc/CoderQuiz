     Explanation:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    ELECTRA uses a training technique called
    <strong>
     Replaced Token Detection
    </strong>
    where instead of predicting masked tokens like in traditional Masked Language Modeling (MLM), the model is trained to distinguish between real and fake tokens. This technique leads to more efficient training and better performance compared to conventional MLM.
