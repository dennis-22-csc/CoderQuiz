    The correct answer is:
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)
    </strong>
    is a technique used to fine-tune language models by incorporating human preferences. It involves:
   </p>
   <p>
    1.
    <strong>
     Pre-training
    </strong>
    the model on large datasets.
   </p>
   <p>
    2.
    <strong>
     Supervised fine-tuning
    </strong>
    with human-labeled examples.
   </p>
   <p>
    3.
    <strong>
     Reinforcement learning
    </strong>
    , where a reward model (trained on human feedback) helps optimize responses.
   </p>
   <p>
    This approach improves model behavior, making it more aligned with user expectations, as seen in
    <strong>
     ChatGPT and GPT-4
    </strong>
    .
