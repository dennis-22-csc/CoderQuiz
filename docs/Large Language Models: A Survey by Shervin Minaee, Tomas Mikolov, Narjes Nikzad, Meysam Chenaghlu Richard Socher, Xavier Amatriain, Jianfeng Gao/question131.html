     Explanation:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT, PaLM, and others are typically trained on
    <strong>
     web-scale corpora
    </strong>
    , meaning they are trained on massive amounts of text data scraped from the web. This data includes a wide variety of content such as books, articles, websites, and other publicly available text sources. The goal is to expose the model to a diverse range of language patterns, contexts, and knowledge so that it can generate coherent and contextually appropriate responses.
   </p>
   <p>
    The large-scale training helps the model generalize better across different tasks and domains, making it more versatile and capable of handling a wide range of inputs.
