    4,What is one of the main challenges in training LLMs?,Limited computational resources,Data sparsity,Lack of labeled data,All of the above,
   </h2>
   <p>
    The correct answer is:
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     D. All of the above
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Training Large Language Models (LLMs) comes with multiple challenges:
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Limited computational resources
    </strong>
    : LLMs require massive GPU/TPU clusters and high memory bandwidth.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Data sparsity
    </strong>
    : Some concepts may not appear frequently in training data, making it difficult for the model to learn them effectively.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Lack of labeled data
    </strong>
    : While pre-training uses unlabeled text, fine-tuning often requires high-quality labeled datasets, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain.
   </p>
   <p>
    These challenges make training LLMs resource-intensive and complex.
