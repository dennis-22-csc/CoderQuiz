   <p>
    The correct answer is:
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     The ability to learn from a small set of examples in the prompt
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     In-context learning
    </strong>
    refers to an LLMâ€™s ability to
    <strong>
     understand and adapt
    </strong>
    to a task based on examples provided
    <strong>
     within the prompt
    </strong>
    , without updating its weights. This allows models like GPT-3 to perform various tasks (e.g., translation, summarization) simply by being given well-structured examples in the input.
