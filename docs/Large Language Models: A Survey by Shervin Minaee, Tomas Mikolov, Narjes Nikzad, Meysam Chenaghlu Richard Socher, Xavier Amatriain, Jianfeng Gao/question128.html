    <strong>
     Pre-training on large datasets
    </strong>

   <h3>
    <strong>
     Explanation:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    A
    <strong>
     task-agnostic process
    </strong>
    is one that is
    <strong>
     not specific to any particular task
    </strong>
    and can be used as a foundation for various applications.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Pre-training on large datasets
    </strong>
    → This is a task-agnostic process because it trains a model on diverse, general-purpose data, allowing it to be adapted for many downstream tasks through fine-tuning.
   </p>
   <h4>
    <strong>
     Why not the others?
    </strong>
   </h4>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Embedding fine-tuning
    </strong>
    → This is
    <strong>
     task-specific
    </strong>
    since embeddings are adjusted based on a particular application.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Task-specific training
    </strong>
    → As the name suggests, it is tailored to a particular task, making it
    <strong>
     not task-agnostic
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Smoothing
    </strong>
    → This is a technique used in
    <strong>
     n-gram models
    </strong>
    to handle unseen words, but it does not apply broadly to all machine learning tasks.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus, the correct answer is
    <strong>
     Pre-training on large datasets
    </strong>
    .
