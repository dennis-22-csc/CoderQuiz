   <p>
    The correct answer is:
   </p>
   <p>
    ✅
    <strong>
     Task-agnostic design
    </strong>
   </p>
   <h3>
    <strong>
     Explanation:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are
    <strong>
     trained on a large corpus of text in an unsupervised manner
    </strong>
    and can then be
    <strong>
     fine-tuned
    </strong>
    for various downstream tasks. Their
    <strong>
     task-agnostic nature
    </strong>
    allows them to be applied to multiple tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis, summarization, translation) without requiring training from scratch.
   </p>
   <h4>
    <strong>
     Why not the other options?
    </strong>
   </h4>
   <p>
    ❌
    <strong>
     Task-specific tuning
    </strong>
    – PLMs
    <strong>
     can be fine-tuned
    </strong>
    for specific tasks, but their main advantage is their broad applicability
    <strong>
     before fine-tuning
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    ❌
    <strong>
     Small model size
    </strong>
    – Many PLMs (e.g., GPT-3, BERT) are
    <strong>
     large
    </strong>
    and computationally expensive. However, techniques like quantization and distillation help make them smaller.
   </p>
   <p>
    ❌
    <strong>
     No training needed
    </strong>
    – PLMs require
    <strong>
     pre-training
    </strong>
    on massive datasets, though users can use them without additional training in some cases (zero-shot learning).
