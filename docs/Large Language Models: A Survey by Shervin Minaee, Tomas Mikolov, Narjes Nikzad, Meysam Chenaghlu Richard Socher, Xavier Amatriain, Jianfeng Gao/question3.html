    3,What does "pre-training" in the context of LLMs refer to?,Fine-tuning the model on a specific task,Training the model on a massive dataset of unlabeled text,Evaluating the model's performance on benchmarks,Deploying the model for real-world applications
   </h2>
   <p>
    The correct answer is:
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Training the model on a massive dataset of unlabeled text
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Pre-training in LLMs refers to the initial phase where the model learns language patterns, grammar, and general knowledge from a vast corpus of
    <strong>
     unlabeled text
    </strong>
    . This stage helps the model develop a strong foundational understanding before being fine-tuned on specific tasks like translation, summarization, or question-answering.
