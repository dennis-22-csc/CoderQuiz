     Explanation:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    UNILM (Unified Language Model) focuses on
    <strong>
     unidirectional modeling
    </strong>
    ,
    <strong>
     bidirectional modeling
    </strong>
    , and
    <strong>
     sequence-to-sequence prediction
    </strong>
    . However,
    <strong>
     next sentence prediction
    </strong>
    is not used in UNILM training. UNILM combines both autoregressive (unidirectional) and denoising (bidirectional) objectives, but it does not include the next sentence prediction task, which was part of BERT's training approach.
