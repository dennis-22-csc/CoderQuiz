    200,What task is NOT used in UNILM training?,Unidirectional modeling,Bidirectional modeling,Next sentence prediction,Sequence-to-sequence prediction,
   </h2>
   <p>
    ✅
    <strong>
     Next sentence prediction
    </strong>
   </p>
   <h3>
    <strong>
     Explanation:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    UNILM (
    <strong>
     Unified Language Model
    </strong>
    ) is designed to handle
    <strong>
     multiple types of language modeling tasks
    </strong>
    , but it does
    <strong>
     not use Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <h3>
    <strong>
     Key Training Tasks in UNILM:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    1.
    <strong>
     Unidirectional Modeling
    </strong>
    → Similar to GPT, where words are predicted
    <strong>
     from left to right
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    2.
    <strong>
     Bidirectional Modeling
    </strong>
    → Similar to BERT, where the model
    <strong>
     looks at both left and right contexts
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    3.
    <strong>
     Sequence-to-Sequence Prediction
    </strong>
    → Similar to T5, useful for
    <strong>
     text generation, translation, and summarization
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <h3>
    <strong>
     Why NSP Is NOT Used in UNILM?
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    * BERT uses
    <strong>
     NSP
    </strong>
    to improve
    <strong>
     sentence relationship understanding
    </strong>
    , but UNILM focuses on
    <strong>
     multi-task learning
    </strong>
    with different attention masks.
   </p>
   <p>
    * Instead of NSP,
    <strong>
     UNILM relies on its sequence-to-sequence objective
    </strong>
    for tasks like text generation.
   </p>
   <h3>
    <strong>
     Why Other Options Are Incorrect?
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Unidirectional Modeling
    </strong>
    → Used in UNILM for autoregressive tasks.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Bidirectional Modeling
    </strong>
    → Used in UNILM for deep context understanding.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Sequence-to-Sequence Prediction
    </strong>
    → Used in UNILM for translation and text generation.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus, the correct answer is
    <strong>
     Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)
    </strong>
    .
