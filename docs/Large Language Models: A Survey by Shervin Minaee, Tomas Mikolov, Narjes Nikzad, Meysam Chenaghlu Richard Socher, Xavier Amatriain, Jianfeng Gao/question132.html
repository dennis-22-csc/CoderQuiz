     Explanation:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    Emergent abilities typically arise in
    <strong>
     larger
    </strong>
    language models as they scale up, particularly when they reach a certain size and complexity. These abilities include tasks that the model was not explicitly trained on, such as performing arithmetic, reasoning, or understanding complex instructions. Smaller language models generally do not exhibit these emergent abilities to the same extent because they lack the scale and complexity necessary for these capabilities to emerge naturally.
