   </h3>
   <p>
    Encoder-only models, such as BERT, are primarily designed for language understanding tasks. They focus on capturing context and semantics in a sequence of text through the use of self-attention mechanisms, making them ideal for tasks like text classification, question answering, and named entity recognition.
