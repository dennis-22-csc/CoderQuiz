    13,What is "multi-step reasoning" in the context of LLMs?,The ability to solve complex tasks by breaking them down into smaller steps,The ability to perform complex calculations,The ability to access external knowledge,None of the above
   </h2>
   <p>
    The correct answer is:
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     The ability to solve complex tasks by breaking them down into smaller steps
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Multi-step reasoning
    </strong>
    allows LLMs to tackle complex problems by logically breaking them down into smaller, sequential steps. This is crucial for tasks like
    <strong>
     math problem-solving, logical reasoning, and coding
    </strong>
    , where step-by-step thinking improves accuracy. Techniques like
    <strong>
     Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting
    </strong>
    enhance multi-step reasoning in LLMs.
