    2,Which architecture is most commonly used in Large Language Models (LLMs)?,Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs),Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),Transformers,Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs)
   </h2>
   <p>
    The correct answer is:
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Transformers
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT and BERT, are based on the
    <strong>
     Transformer
    </strong>
    architecture. Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to process entire sequences in parallel, making them highly efficient and effective for handling long-range dependencies in text. This is a major improvement over RNNs and LSTMs, which process sequences sequentially and struggle with long dependencies.
