     Faster training with parallel computation
    </strong>

    <strong>
     Explanation:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    Transformers allow for
    <strong>
     parallel computation
    </strong>
    , which significantly speeds up training compared to RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks), which process sequences one step at a time. This is one of the major advantages of Transformers over RNNs.
