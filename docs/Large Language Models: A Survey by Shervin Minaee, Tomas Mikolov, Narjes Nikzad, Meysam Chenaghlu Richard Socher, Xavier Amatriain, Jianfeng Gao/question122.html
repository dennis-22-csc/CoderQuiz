   <h3>
    <strong>
     Explanation:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    Task-specific models are designed for
    <strong>
     a single task
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
     do not generalize well
    </strong>
    beyond their training domain. Unlike
    <strong>
     pre-trained language models (PLMs)
    </strong>
    , they lack adaptability to new or unseen tasks.

   <h3>
    <strong>
     Breakdown of Each Option:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     General-purpose embeddings
    </strong>
    → Incorrect. Task-specific models usually have embeddings tailored to a specific dataset, not general-purpose ones.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Small datasets
    </strong>
    → Not always true. Some task-specific models use large datasets, but they are still limited in scope.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Fixed hidden space
    </strong>
    → Not necessarily true. Hidden layers can be flexible, but the model's knowledge is constrained.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Low adaptability
    </strong>
    →
    <strong>
     Correct!
    </strong>
    These models struggle with new tasks outside their domain.

     Final Answer:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    ✅
