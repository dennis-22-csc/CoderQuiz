   <h2>
    30,What is a major limitation of early neural language models?,Data sparsity,Lack of context,Limited computational resources,All of the above
   </h2>
   <p>
    The correct answer is:
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     All of the above
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Early
    <strong>
     neural language models
    </strong>
    faced several limitations:
   </p>
   <p>
    1.
    <strong>
     Data Sparsity
    </strong>
    – They struggled with
    <strong>
     rare words
    </strong>
    and required large labeled datasets.
   </p>
   <p>
    2.
    <strong>
     Lack of Context
    </strong>
    – Models like
    <strong>
     n-grams and early RNNs
    </strong>
    had
    <strong>
     short context windows
    </strong>
    , leading to poor long-term dependencies.
   </p>
   <p>
    3.
    <strong>
     Limited Computational Resources
    </strong>
    – Training deep models was
    <strong>
     computationally expensive
    </strong>
    , making large-scale learning impractical.
   </p>
   <p>
    These challenges led to the development of
    <strong>
     attention mechanisms and transformers
    </strong>
    , which improved context handling and efficiency.
