    The correct answer is:
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Training a smaller model by learning from a larger model
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Knowledge distillation
    </strong>
    is a technique where a
    <strong>
     large, pre-trained "teacher" model
    </strong>
    transfers its knowledge to a
    <strong>
     smaller "student" model
    </strong>
    . This process helps:
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Reduce model size
    </strong>
    while maintaining performance
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Speed up inference
    </strong>
    for deployment on edge devices
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Lower computational costs
    </strong>
    compared to training a large model from scratch
   </p>
   <p>
    The student model is trained using the teacherâ€™s
    <strong>
     soft labels
    </strong>
    (probabilistic outputs), helping it generalize better than training on raw data alone.
