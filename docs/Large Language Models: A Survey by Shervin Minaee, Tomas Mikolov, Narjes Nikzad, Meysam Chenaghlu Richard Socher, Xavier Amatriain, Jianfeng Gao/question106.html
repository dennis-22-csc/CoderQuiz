    106,What are emergent abilities in LLMs?,Abilities present in all models,Abilities unique to small models,Abilities that arise at scale,Abilities specific to GPT-4,
   </h2>
   <p>
    The correct answer is:
   </p>
   <p>
    ✅
    <strong>
     Abilities that arise at scale
    </strong>
   </p>
   <h3>
    <strong>
     Explanation:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Emergent abilities
    </strong>
    in Large Language Models (LLMs) refer to
    <strong>
     new capabilities that only appear when a model reaches a certain scale
    </strong>
    in terms of
    <strong>
     parameters, data, and computation
    </strong>
    . These abilities are
    <strong>
     not explicitly programmed
    </strong>
    but emerge as a result of the complex interactions within the model.
   </p>
   <h4>
    <strong>
     Examples of Emergent Abilities:
    </strong>
   </h4>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     In-context learning
    </strong>
    (learning from a prompt without additional training)
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Better reasoning and few-shot learning
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Understanding and following complex instructions
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Multi-step problem-solving
    </strong>
   </p>
   <h4>
    <strong>
     Why not the other options?
    </strong>
   </h4>
   <p>
    ❌
    <strong>
     Abilities present in all models
    </strong>
    – Smaller models often lack emergent abilities; they only appear at
    <strong>
     large scales
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    ❌
    <strong>
     Abilities unique to small models
    </strong>
    – The opposite is true; emergent abilities are observed in
    <strong>
     larger models
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    ❌
    <strong>
     Abilities specific to GPT-4
    </strong>
    – Emergent abilities are observed in
    <strong>
     many LLMs
    </strong>
    , not just GPT-4 (e.g., GPT-3, PaLM, LLaMA).
   </p>

    <strong>
     Final Answer:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    ✅
    <strong>
