   <h3>
    <strong>
     Explanation:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    Among these options,
    <strong>
     GPT models (particularly GPT-3.5 and GPT-4)
    </strong>
    were explicitly designed and fine-tuned for
    <strong>
     instruction following
    </strong>
    using
    <strong>
     Instruction Tuning
    </strong>
    and
    <strong>
     Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <h3>
    <strong>
     Breakdown of Each Option:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     GPT
    </strong>
    → OpenAI's GPT-3.5 &amp; GPT-4 were fine-tuned for instruction-following (e.g., ChatGPT).
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     PaLM
    </strong>
    → While capable of instruction following, it wasn’t originally designed
    <strong>
     primarily
    </strong>
    for that.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     LLaMA
    </strong>
    → Focused on efficiency &amp; research, not explicitly built for instruction-following tasks.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     All of the above
    </strong>
    → Not entirely correct since
    <strong>
     GPT
    </strong>
    stands out in this area.
   </p>

    <strong>
     Final Answer:
