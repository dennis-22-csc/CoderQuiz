   <h2>
    26,What is one benefit of using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)?,Reduced number of trainable parameters,Faster training,Smaller model size,All of the above
   </h2>
   <p>
    The correct answer is:
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     All of the above
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
    </strong>
    is a technique that makes fine-tuning
    <strong>
     LLMs more efficient
    </strong>
    by modifying only a small subset of parameters. Benefits include:
   </p>
   <p>
    1.
    <strong>
     Reduced number of trainable parameters
    </strong>
    – Instead of updating the entire model, LoRA adds small low-rank matrices, minimizing computational cost.
   </p>
   <p>
    2.
    <strong>
     Faster training
    </strong>
    – Since fewer parameters are updated, training requires less time and fewer resources.
   </p>
   <p>
    3.
    <strong>
     Smaller model size
    </strong>
    – LoRA keeps the base model unchanged and only stores small adapter weights, reducing storage needs.
   </p>
   <p>
    LoRA is widely used for
    <strong>
     efficient fine-tuning of large models
    </strong>
    in applications like
    <strong>
     personalized AI assistants and domain-specific LLMs
    </strong>
    .
