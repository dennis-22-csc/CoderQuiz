    55,What architecture revolutionized the development of neural language models?,Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs),Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),Transformers,Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs),
   </h2>
   <p>
    The correct answer is:
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Transformers
    </strong>
   </p>
   <h3>
    Explanation:
   </h3>
   <p>
    The
    <strong>
     Transformer architecture
    </strong>
    , introduced in the paper *"Attention Is All You Need"* (Vaswani et al., 2017), revolutionized neural language models by replacing sequential models like
    <strong>
     RNNs and LSTMs
    </strong>
    with a fully
    <strong>
     attention-based mechanism
    </strong>
    . This allowed for
    <strong>
     parallel processing
    </strong>
    , making training more efficient and improving performance on large-scale text data.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Why Not the Other Options?
   </h3>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     RNNs
    </strong>
    : Limited by sequential processing, making them slow and inefficient for long sequences.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     LSTMs
    </strong>
    : Improved upon RNNs with better long-term dependencies but still suffered from sequential processing limitations.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     CNNs
    </strong>
    : Effective in capturing
    <strong>
     local patterns
    </strong>
    , but not ideal for long-range dependencies in text.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Key Benefits of Transformers:
   </h3>
   <p>
    ✅
    <strong>
     Self-attention
    </strong>
    → Models long-range dependencies efficiently.
   </p>
   <p>
    ✅
    <strong>
     Parallelization
    </strong>
    → Enables faster training on large datasets.
   </p>
   <p>
    ✅
    <strong>
     Scalability
    </strong>
    → Used in large models like
    <strong>
     BERT, GPT, T5, and PaLM
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus,
    <strong>
     Transformers are the foundation of modern LLMs and have set the standard for state-of-the-art NLP models.
