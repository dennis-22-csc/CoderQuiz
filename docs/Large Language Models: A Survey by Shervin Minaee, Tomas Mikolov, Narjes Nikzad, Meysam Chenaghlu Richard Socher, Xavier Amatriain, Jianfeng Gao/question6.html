   <h2>
    6,What are embedding vectors in the context of neural language models?,High-dimensional representations of words,Low-dimensional representations of words,Discrete representations of words,None of the above,
   </h2>
   <p>
    The correct answer is:
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Low-dimensional representations of words
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    Embedding vectors are
    <strong>
     low-dimensional continuous representations
    </strong>
    of words, capturing semantic relationships based on context. These vectors are learned during training and allow similar words to have similar representations in a multi-dimensional space. Examples include
    <strong>
     Word2Vec, GloVe, and Transformer-based embeddings
    </strong>
    like those from BERT and GPT.
