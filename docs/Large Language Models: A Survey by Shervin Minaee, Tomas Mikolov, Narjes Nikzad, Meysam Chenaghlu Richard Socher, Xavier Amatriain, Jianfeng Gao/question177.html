     Explanation:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformer-based model that leverages bidirectional context, meaning it considers both the left and right context of words in a sentence during training. This allows BERT to understand language better compared to previous models that only considered one direction.
