    54,What is a key characteristic of pre-trained language models (PLMs)?,Task-specific training,Task-agnostic training,Limited data requirements,All of the above,
   </h2>
   <p>
    The correct answer is:
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Task-agnostic training
    </strong>
   </p>
   <h3>
    Explanation:
   </h3>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs)
    </strong>
    are trained on
    <strong>
     large-scale corpora
    </strong>
    in a
    <strong>
     task-agnostic
    </strong>
    manner, meaning they are not limited to a specific task during training. Instead, they learn
    <strong>
     general language representations
    </strong>
    , which can later be fine-tuned for specific tasks like translation, summarization, or question answering.
   </p>
   <h3>
    Why?
   </h3>
   <p>
    1.
    <strong>
     Task-agnostic training
    </strong>
    → PLMs learn general linguistic knowledge from massive datasets before fine-tuning for specific applications.
   </p>
   <p>
    2.
    <strong>
     Not task-specific training
    </strong>
    → Unlike traditional models trained for one task, PLMs can adapt to multiple tasks via fine-tuning.
   </p>
   <p>
    3.
    <strong>
     Not limited data requirements
    </strong>
    → PLMs require massive amounts of text data for effective pre-training.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus,
    <strong>
     PLMs are designed to be task-agnostic during pre-training, making them highly adaptable across various NLP tasks
    </strong>
    .
