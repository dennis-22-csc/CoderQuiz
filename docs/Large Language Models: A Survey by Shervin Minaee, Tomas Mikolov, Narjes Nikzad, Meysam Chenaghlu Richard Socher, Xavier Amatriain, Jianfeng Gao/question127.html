    ✅
    <strong>
     Meta's training methods
    </strong>
   </p>
   <h3>
    <strong>
     Explanation:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) is distinct because of
    <strong>
     Meta’s specialized training approach
    </strong>
    , which focuses on efficiency and smaller-scale models that achieve high performance with fewer resources.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Not recurrent design
    </strong>
    → LLaMA is a transformer-based model, not RNN-based.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Not instruction tuning focus
    </strong>
    → Unlike models like ChatGPT (GPT-4-turbo), LLaMA was not primarily designed for instruction following.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Not web-scale corpora use
    </strong>
    → While LLaMA is trained on diverse datasets, it is optimized to be efficient rather than relying solely on massive web-scale data like GPT models.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus, the correct answer is
    <strong>
     Meta's training methods
    </strong>
    .
