     Explanation:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    N-gram models are task-agnostic because they are based on the statistical properties of word sequences without being specifically trained for a particular task. They can be used for various tasks like language modeling, text generation, and speech recognition, as they rely on the probability of word sequences rather than task-specific features.
