    116,What is the purpose of smoothing in n-gram models?,To handle unseen n-grams,To reduce model size,To increase training speed,To enhance embeddings,
   </h2>
   <p>
    The correct answer is:
   </p>
   <p>
    ✅
    <strong>
     To handle unseen n-grams
    </strong>
   </p>
   <h3>
    <strong>
     Explanation:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    Smoothing techniques are used in
    <strong>
     n-gram language models
    </strong>
    to
    <strong>
     assign probabilities to unseen n-grams
    </strong>
    (word sequences) that were
    <strong>
     not encountered in the training data
    </strong>
    . This helps prevent
    <strong>
     zero probability issues
    </strong>
    and improves generalization.
   </p>
   <h3>
    <strong>
     Common Smoothing Techniques:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Laplace Smoothing (Add-1 Smoothing):
    </strong>
    Adds a small constant to all counts to avoid zero probabilities.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Add-k Smoothing:
    </strong>
    Similar to Laplace but with a tunable constant *k*.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Kneser-Ney Smoothing:
    </strong>
    More advanced; redistributes probability mass based on word frequency.
   </p>
   <h3>
    <strong>
     Why not the other options?
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    ❌
    <strong>
     To reduce model size
    </strong>
    → Smoothing does not shrink models; it adjusts probability estimates.
   </p>
   <p>
    ❌
    <strong>
     To increase training speed
    </strong>
    → It actually adds computation, slightly slowing down training.
   </p>
   <p>
    ❌
    <strong>
     To enhance embeddings
    </strong>
    → Smoothing is for probability estimation, not word embeddings.
   </p>

    <strong>
     Final Answer:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    ✅
    <strong>
     To handle unseen n-grams
