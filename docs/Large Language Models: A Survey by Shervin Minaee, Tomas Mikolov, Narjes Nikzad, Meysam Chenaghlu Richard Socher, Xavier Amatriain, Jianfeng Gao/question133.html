   <p>
    Instruction tuning is a fine-tuning method for LLMs that focuses on training the model to follow specific instructions or perform certain tasks based on given prompts. It is a form of fine-tuning where the model learns to better understand and respond to human instructions, improving its performance on tasks that require comprehension and following of specific directions.
