   <p>
    Emergent abilities in large language models (LLMs) refer to complex behaviors or capabilities that arise as the model scales up, such as multi-step reasoning, advanced problem-solving, and understanding nuanced contexts, which may not be present in smaller models. These abilities often emerge when the model reaches a certain size or is trained on sufficiently large datasets.
