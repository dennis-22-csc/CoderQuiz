     Explanation:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    The pre-training objective of
    <strong>
     ELECTRA
    </strong>
    is
    <strong>
     replaced token detection
    </strong>
    . In ELECTRA, instead of predicting the masked tokens (like in traditional masked language modeling), the model learns to distinguish between "real" tokens and "fake" tokens generated by a small generator network. This approach is more efficient because it allows the model to learn from all tokens in a sequence, rather than just the masked ones.
