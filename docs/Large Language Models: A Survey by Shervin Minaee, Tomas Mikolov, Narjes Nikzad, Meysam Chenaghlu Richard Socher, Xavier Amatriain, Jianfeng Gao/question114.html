   <h2>
    114,Which component allows transformers to process input in parallel?,Feed-forward layers,Attention mechanism,Recurrent layers,Pooling layers,
   </h2>
   <p>
    The correct answer is:
   </p>
   <p>
    ✅
    <strong>
     Attention mechanism
    </strong>
   </p>
   <h3>
    <strong>
     Explanation:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    Transformers process input
    <strong>
     in parallel
    </strong>
    due to their
    <strong>
     self-attention mechanism
    </strong>
    , which allows them to:
   </p>
   <p>
    * Attend to
    <strong>
     all words in a sequence simultaneously
    </strong>
    , rather than sequentially (like RNNs).
   </p>
   <p>
    * Compute relationships between words in a
    <strong>
     single step
    </strong>
    , making processing
    <strong>
     faster and more efficient
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    * Enable scalability for large datasets and models like GPT, BERT, and T5.
   </p>
   <h3>
    <strong>
     Why not the other options?
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    ❌
    <strong>
     Feed-forward layers
    </strong>
    → Process data independently but do not handle dependencies between words.
   </p>
   <p>
    ❌
    <strong>
     Recurrent layers
    </strong>
    → Found in RNNs/LSTMs, which process input
    <strong>
     sequentially
    </strong>
    , not in parallel.
   </p>
   <p>
    ❌
    <strong>
     Pooling layers
    </strong>
    → Used in CNNs, not transformers, and do not contribute to parallel processing.
   </p>
   <h3>
    <strong>
     Final Answer:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    ✅
    <strong>
     Attention mechanism
