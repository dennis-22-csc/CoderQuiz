    <strong>
     Explanation:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Emergent abilities
    </strong>
    refer to capabilities that
    <strong>
     suddenly appear
    </strong>
    in large-scale models but are not present in smaller ones. These abilities emerge as model size, training data, and compute power increase.
   </p>
   <h3>
    <strong>
     LLMs with Emergent Abilities:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     GPT-3
    </strong>
    → Demonstrates in-context learning and reasoning.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     LLaMA
    </strong>
    → Shows strong few-shot and reasoning abilities.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     PaLM
    </strong>
    → Exhibits advanced reasoning and multi-step problem-solving.
   </p>
   <p>
    Since
    <strong>
     emergent abilities
    </strong>
    are a general phenomenon in
    <strong>
     large-scale LLMs
    </strong>
    , all of these models demonstrate them.
   </p>
