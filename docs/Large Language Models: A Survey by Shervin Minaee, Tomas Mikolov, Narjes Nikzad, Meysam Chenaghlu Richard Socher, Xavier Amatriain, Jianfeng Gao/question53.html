    53,How do early neural language models (NLMs) address data sparsity?,Using smoothing techniques,Mapping words to low-dimensional continuous vectors,Using recurrent neural networks,All of the above,
   </h2>
   <p>
    The correct answer is:
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Mapping words to low-dimensional continuous vectors
    </strong>
   </p>
   <h3>
    Explanation:
   </h3>
   <p>
    Early
    <strong>
     neural language models (NLMs)
    </strong>
    addressed
    <strong>
     data sparsity
    </strong>
    by using
    <strong>
     word embeddings
    </strong>
    , which map words to
    <strong>
     low-dimensional continuous vectors
    </strong>
    . This technique allows models to generalize better by capturing
    <strong>
     semantic similarities
    </strong>
    between words.
   </p>
   <h3>
    How It Works:
   </h3>
   <p>
    1.
    <strong>
     Traditional models (e.g., N-grams) struggle with unseen words
    </strong>
    → They assign
    <strong>
     zero probabilities
    </strong>
    to new word sequences.
   </p>
   <p>
    2.
    <strong>
     NLMs use embeddings
    </strong>
    (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) → Words with similar meanings have
    <strong>
     similar vector representations
    </strong>
    , reducing sparsity.
   </p>
   <p>
    3.
    <strong>
     Neural networks learn meaningful word relationships
    </strong>
    → Instead of storing
    <strong>
     individual word probabilities
    </strong>
    , they learn patterns from
    <strong>
     contextual similarity
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <h3>
    Why Not the Other Options?
   </h3>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Smoothing techniques
    </strong>
    are used in
    <strong>
     statistical models (e.g., N-grams)
    </strong>
    but not in neural models.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
    </strong>
    help with sequential data but don’t directly solve sparsity.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     "All of the above" is incorrect
    </strong>
    because early NLMs mainly relied on embeddings, not smoothing.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus,
    <strong>
     word embeddings revolutionized language modeling
    </strong>
    by overcoming the sparsity issue and improving generalization.
