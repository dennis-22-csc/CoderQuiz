   <h3>
    <strong>
     Explanation:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) aims to develop models that can
    <strong>
     reason, learn, and perform across diverse tasks
    </strong>
    like a human.
    <strong>
     LLMs serve as the foundation
    </strong>
    for AGI research because they exhibit:
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Emergent abilities
    </strong>
    (e.g., reasoning, in-context learning)
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Scalability
    </strong>
    (better performance with more data and compute)
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Versatility
    </strong>
    (handling various NLP tasks without retraining)
   </p>
   <h3>
    <strong>
     Breakdown of Each Option:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Neural networks
    </strong>
    → ❌ Too broad; LLMs are a subset of neural networks.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Large language models
    </strong>
    → ✅
    <strong>
     Correct!
    </strong>
    LLMs like GPT and PaLM drive AGI research.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Statistical models
    </strong>
    → ❌ Outdated for AGI research; they lack reasoning capabilities.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Embedding-based models
    </strong>
    → ❌ Useful for NLP but not the foundation of AGI.
