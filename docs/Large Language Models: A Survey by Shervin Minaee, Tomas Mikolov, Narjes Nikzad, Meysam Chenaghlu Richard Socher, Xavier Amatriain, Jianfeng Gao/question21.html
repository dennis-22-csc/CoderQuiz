   </h2>
   <p>
    The correct answer is:
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     A technique to guide LLMs through a reasoning process
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting
    </strong>
    helps
    <strong>
     LLMs
    </strong>
    improve their reasoning by
    <strong>
     explicitly breaking down complex problems into step-by-step logical explanations
    </strong>
    . This is particularly useful for tasks like
    <strong>
     math problem-solving, logical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning
    </strong>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    For example, instead of asking:
   </p>
   <p>
    *"What is 27 Ã— 14?"*
   </p>
   <p>
    A CoT prompt would guide the model:
   </p>
   <p>
    *"First, multiply 27 by 10. Then multiply 27 by 4. Finally, add the results."*
   </p>
   <p>
    This structured approach enhances accuracy and interpretability.
