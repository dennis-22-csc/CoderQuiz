    The correct answer is:
   </p>
   <p>
    <strong>
     A method for training LLMs
    </strong>
   </p>
   <p>
    The
    <strong>
     pre-training and fine-tuning
    </strong>
    paradigm is a common approach for training Large Language Models (LLMs). It consists of two stages:
   </p>
   <p>
    1.
    <strong>
     Pre-training
    </strong>
    : The model learns general language patterns from a large, unlabeled text corpus.
   </p>
   <p>
    2.
    <strong>
     Fine-tuning
    </strong>
    : The model is further trained on a smaller, task-specific dataset to adapt it for specialized applications like translation, summarization, or sentiment analysis.
   </p>
   <p>
    This approach helps LLMs generalize well while being adaptable to specific tasks.
