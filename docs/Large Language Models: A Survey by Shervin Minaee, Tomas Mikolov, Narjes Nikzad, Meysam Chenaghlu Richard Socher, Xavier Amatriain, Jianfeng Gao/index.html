<p><strong>Quantization</strong> is a technique for making <strong>LLMs more efficient</strong> by:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Reducing model size</strong> – It <strong>lowers the precision</strong> of numerical weights (e.g., from <strong>32-bit floating-point to 8-bit integers</strong>), reducing memory usage.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Speeding up inference</strong> – Smaller models require <strong>fewer computations</strong>, making them faster on CPUs and GPUs.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Lowering hardware requirements</strong> – Enables <strong>LLMs to run on edge devices</strong> with limited resources.</p>
<p>Quantization is widely used to <strong>optimize LLMs</strong> for deployment on <strong>mobile devices, embedded systems, and cloud applications</strong>.</p>

<h2>38,Is greedy search a computationally expensive decoding strategy?,No,Yes,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p><strong>No</strong></p>
<p><strong>Greedy search</strong> is <strong>not</strong> a computationally expensive decoding strategy because:</p>
<p>1. <strong>It selects the highest-probability token at each step</strong> without considering alternative sequences.</p>
<p>2. <strong>It does not explore multiple paths</strong> like <strong>beam search</strong>, making it <strong>faster and less resource-intensive</strong>.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Lower memory usage</strong> since it processes <strong>only one token at a time</strong>, unlike <strong>sampling-based methods</strong> that track multiple candidates.</p>
<p>However, <strong>greedy search</strong> can produce <strong>suboptimal outputs</strong> because it <strong>doesn't account for long-term coherence</strong> in text generation.</p>
</div>
<div class="question" id="question39">
<h2>39,Is tokenization a necessary preprocessing step for LLMs?,Yes,No,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p><strong>Yes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tokenization</strong> is a <strong>necessary preprocessing step</strong> for LLMs because:</p>
<p>1. <strong>It converts raw text into smaller units (tokens)</strong> – These tokens can be <strong>words, subwords, or characters</strong>.</p>
<p>2. <strong>It enables LLMs to process text efficiently</strong> – Neural networks operate on <strong>numerical representations</strong>, so text must be <strong>converted into token IDs</strong>.</p>
<p>3. <strong>It improves model generalization</strong> – Subword tokenization (e.g., <strong>Byte Pair Encoding, WordPiece</strong>) helps handle <strong>rare or unseen words</strong> effectively.</p>
<p>Without tokenization, <strong>LLMs wouldn't understand input text</strong>, making it a fundamental step in NLP pipelines.</p>

<h2>40,Is data cleaning important for improving LLM performance?,Yes,No,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p><strong>Yes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Data cleaning</strong> is important for improving <strong>LLM performance</strong> because:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Removes noise and inconsistencies</strong> – Eliminates <strong>duplicates, typos, and irrelevant text</strong> that could degrade model quality.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Reduces biases</strong> – Filtering <strong>offensive, misleading, or imbalanced</strong> data helps create a <strong>fairer model</strong>.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Improves generalization</strong> – A well-cleaned dataset ensures the model learns <strong>useful patterns</strong> rather than memorizing errors.</p>
<p>High-quality training data leads to <strong>better accuracy, coherence, and factual consistency</strong> in LLM outputs.</p>
</div>
<div class="question" id="question41">
<h2>41,Is "in-context learning" a characteristic of only smaller LLMs?,False,True,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p><strong>False</strong></p>
<p><strong>In-context learning</strong> is <strong>not limited to smaller LLMs</strong>—it is actually a key feature of <strong>larger LLMs</strong>.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Larger models demonstrate stronger in-context learning</strong> – They can <strong>generalize</strong> from examples in the prompt <strong>without additional training</strong>.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Smaller models have limited in-context learning</strong> – They may struggle to understand <strong>complex patterns</strong> from just a few examples.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Scaling laws show improved performance</strong> – Bigger models tend to <strong>learn more effectively</strong> from context due to their increased capacity.</p>
<p>Thus, <strong>in-context learning is more prominent in larger LLMs</strong> like <strong>GPT-4, PaLM, and LLaMA 2</strong> rather than smaller ones.</p>

<h2>42,Is "hallucination" a desirable characteristic of LLMs?,False,True,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p><strong>False</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hallucination</strong> is <strong>not</strong> a desirable characteristic of LLMs because:</p>
<p>1. <strong>It leads to factually incorrect outputs</strong> – The model generates <strong>plausible but false information</strong>, which can be misleading.</p>
<p>2. <strong>It reduces trust and reliability</strong> – Users may <strong>lose confidence</strong> in LLMs if they consistently produce <strong>inaccurate responses</strong>.</p>
<p>3. <strong>It can have real-world consequences</strong> – In areas like <strong>medicine, law, or finance</strong>, hallucinations can <strong>spread misinformation or cause harm</strong>.</p>
<p>Researchers are actively working on <strong>reducing hallucinations</strong> using techniques like <strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), fine-tuning, and RLHF</strong>.</p>

<h2>43,Is beam search typically more computationally expensive than greedy search?,True,False,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p><strong>True</strong></p>
<p><strong>Beam search</strong> is typically <strong>more computationally expensive</strong> than <strong>greedy search</strong> because:</p>
<p>1. <strong>It keeps track of multiple possible sequences</strong> (beam width > 1), whereas <strong>greedy search selects only the highest-probability token at each step</strong>.</p>
<p>2. <strong>It requires more memory and processing power</strong> since it maintains and evaluates multiple candidate sequences simultaneously.</p>
<p>3. <strong>It searches a broader space for better outputs</strong>, leading to <strong>higher-quality text generation</strong> but at the cost of increased computation.</p>
<p>While <strong>beam search improves fluency and coherence</strong>, it is <strong>slower</strong> and <strong>more resource-intensive</strong> compared to <strong>greedy search</strong>.</p>

<h2>44,Is RLHF an alignment technique that solely relies on AI feedback?,False,True,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p><strong>False</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)</strong> <strong>does not solely rely on AI feedback</strong>—it incorporates <strong>human preferences</strong> in the training process.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Human evaluators rank model outputs</strong> – AI generates responses, and humans provide <strong>feedback</strong> on which ones are better.</p>
<p>2. <strong>A reward model is trained based on human preferences</strong> – This model helps guide the LLM towards more <strong>aligned and desirable responses</strong>.</p>
<p>3. <strong>RL is used to fine-tune the LLM</strong> – The AI learns to optimize its responses using <strong>reinforcement learning</strong> guided by human feedback.</p>
<p>While <strong>AI models assist in training</strong>, <strong>human feedback is essential</strong> in shaping model behavior and improving alignment.</p>

<h2>45,Is the "pre-training and fine-tuning" paradigm specific to LLMs?,False,True,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p><strong>False</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm</strong> is <strong>not specific</strong> to LLMs—it is widely used in <strong>various machine learning domains</strong>, including:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Computer Vision</strong> – Models like <strong>ResNet and ViTs</strong> are pre-trained on large image datasets (e.g., <strong>ImageNet</strong>) and fine-tuned for specific tasks (e.g., medical imaging, object detection).</p>
<p>2. <strong>Speech Recognition</strong> – Models like <strong>wav2vec 2.0</strong> are pre-trained on unlabeled speech data and fine-tuned for speech-to-text applications.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong> – Pre-trained agents in robotics can be fine-tuned for <strong>specific environments</strong>.</p>

<h2>46,Is the attention mechanism a core component of the transformer architecture?,True,False,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p><strong>True</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>attention mechanism</strong> is a <strong>core component</strong> of the <strong>transformer architecture</strong>, specifically <strong>self-attention (Scaled Dot-Product Attention)</strong>.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Enables parallel processing</strong> – Unlike RNNs, transformers use <strong>self-attention</strong> to process all tokens <strong>simultaneously</strong>, improving efficiency.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Captures long-range dependencies</strong> – Self-attention allows the model to <strong>weigh the importance of each word</strong> in a sequence, regardless of distance.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Key innovation behind LLMs</strong> – <strong>Multi-Head Attention</strong> enhances the model's ability to focus on <strong>different aspects</strong> of input text.</p>
<p>Without the attention mechanism, transformers <strong>wouldn't function effectively</strong>, making it the <strong>backbone</strong> of models like <strong>GPT, BERT, and T5</strong>.</p>

<h2>47,Is data sparsity a significant challenge in training early language models?,True,False,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p><strong>True</strong></p>
<p><strong>Data sparsity</strong> was a <strong>significant challenge</strong> in training <strong>early language models</strong> because:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Limited training data</strong> – Early models lacked <strong>large-scale datasets</strong>, making it difficult to generalize.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Rare word problem</strong> – Words with <strong>low occurrence</strong> in training data were <strong>poorly represented</strong>, leading to <strong>low-quality predictions</strong>.</p>
<p>3. <strong>N-gram models struggled</strong> – Traditional <strong>n-gram models</strong> couldn't effectively capture long-range dependencies due to <strong>sparse co-occurrences</strong>.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Neural networks helped mitigate this</strong> – Techniques like <strong>word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) and transformers</strong> improved the representation of <strong>rare words</strong> and <strong>contextual understanding</strong>.</p>
<p>Modern LLMs address data sparsity by leveraging <strong>massive pre-training datasets</strong> and <strong>context-aware embeddings</strong>.</p>

<h2>48,Is knowledge distillation a technique for creating smaller more efficient models?,True,False,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p><strong>True</strong></p>
<p><strong>Knowledge distillation</strong> is a technique used to create <strong>smaller, more efficient models</strong> by transferring knowledge from a <strong>large (teacher) model</strong> to a <strong>smaller (student) model</strong>.</p>
<h3>Key Benefits:</h3>
<p>1. <strong>Reduces model size</strong> – The student model is much smaller but retains most of the teacher model's performance.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Improves efficiency</strong> – Requires <strong>less computation</strong>, making it <strong>faster and more cost-effective</strong>.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Maintains accuracy</strong> – The student model learns to <strong>mimic</strong> the teacher’s outputs, preserving key insights.</p>
<p>This technique is widely used in <strong>LLMs, computer vision, and speech recognition</strong> to deploy models on <strong>resource-constrained devices</strong> like <strong>mobile phones</strong>.</p>

<div class="question" id="question49">
<h2>49,Is RAG a technique that solely relies on internal model knowledge?,False,True,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p><strong>False</strong></p>
<p><strong>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</strong> does <strong>not</strong> solely rely on internal model knowledge. Instead, it <strong>enhances LLMs</strong> by retrieving relevant information from <strong>external sources</strong> before generating responses.</p>
<h3>How RAG Works:</h3>
<p>1. <strong>Retrieval</strong> – The model fetches <strong>relevant documents</strong> or facts from a <strong>knowledge base</strong> (e.g., Wikipedia, private databases).</p>
<p>2. <strong>Augmentation</strong> – The retrieved information is <strong>incorporated into the prompt</strong> given to the LLM.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Generation</strong> – The model generates a response using both its <strong>internal knowledge</strong> and <strong>retrieved information</strong>.</p>
<h3>Why RAG is Useful:</h3>
<p>* <strong>Improves factual accuracy</strong> (reduces hallucinations).</p>
<p>* <strong>Keeps responses up-to-date</strong> (retrieves the latest information).</p>
<p>* <strong>Allows domain-specific knowledge retrieval</strong> (e.g., finance, law, medicine).</p>
<p>Thus, RAG <strong>combines both internal model knowledge and external retrieval</strong>, making it <strong>more reliable</strong> than standalone LLMs.</p>

<h2>50,Are LLM agents designed to operate autonomously?,True,False</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p><strong>True</strong></p>
<p><strong>LLM agents</strong> are designed to operate <strong>autonomously</strong> by interacting with their environment, making decisions, and executing tasks <strong>without constant human intervention</strong>.</p>
<h3>Key Characteristics of LLM Agents:</h3>
<p>1. <strong>Autonomous Decision-Making</strong> – Can perform <strong>multi-step reasoning</strong>, plan actions, and refine outputs dynamically.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Tool Use & API Calls</strong> – Can integrate with <strong>external tools</strong>, databases, or APIs to retrieve and process information.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Memory & Adaptation</strong> – Some agents have <strong>memory mechanisms</strong> to retain context across interactions.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Task Execution</strong> – Used in <strong>chatbots, research assistants, and automation systems</strong>.</p>
<h3>Examples:</h3>
<p>* <strong>Auto-GPT, BabyAGI</strong> – Fully autonomous AI agents that can set goals and execute tasks.</p>
<p>* <strong>ChatGPT Plugins</strong> – Use tools like search engines or calculators <strong>autonomously</strong> when needed.</p>
<p>While <strong>human oversight</strong> is often preferred for safety, LLM agents are fundamentally <strong>designed to function autonomously</strong> in many scenarios.</p>

<h2>52,What is a major limitation of n-gram models?,Limited context,High computational cost,Data sparsity,All of the above,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p><strong>All of the above</strong></p>
<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p><strong>N-gram models</strong> are simple but have several major limitations:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Limited Context</strong> –</p>
<p>   * N-gram models <strong>only consider a fixed number of previous words</strong> (e.g., bigrams use 1 word, trigrams use 2).</p>
<p>   * This means they <strong>fail to capture long-range dependencies</strong> in text.</p>
<p>2. <strong>High Computational Cost</strong> –</p>
<p>   * Larger n-grams require <strong>more memory and processing power</strong>.</p>
<p>   * Storing probabilities for all possible n-grams <strong>grows exponentially</strong> with n.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Data Sparsity</strong> –</p>
<p>   * Many word combinations <strong>never appear in training data</strong>, leading to <strong>zero probabilities</strong> for unseen sequences.</p>
<p>   * <strong>Smoothing techniques</strong> (e.g., Laplace smoothing) are needed to handle this.</p>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>* A <strong>trigram model</strong> (“the cat sits”) can predict the next word.</p>
<p>* But it <strong>cannot understand deeper meaning</strong> across longer sentences.</p>
<p>Thus, <strong>n-gram models struggle with context, efficiency, and data sparsity</strong>, making them less effective than modern <strong>neural language models (e.g., Transformers)</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="question" id="question53">
<h2>53,How do early neural language models (NLMs) address data sparsity?,Using smoothing techniques,Mapping words to low-dimensional continuous vectors,Using recurrent neural networks,All of the above,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p><strong>Mapping words to low-dimensional continuous vectors</strong></p>
<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Early <strong>neural language models (NLMs)</strong> addressed <strong>data sparsity</strong> by using <strong>word embeddings</strong>, which map words to <strong>low-dimensional continuous vectors</strong>. This technique allows models to generalize better by capturing <strong>semantic similarities</strong> between words.</p>
<h3>How It Works:</h3>
<p>1. <strong>Traditional models (e.g., N-grams) struggle with unseen words</strong> → They assign <strong>zero probabilities</strong> to new word sequences.</p>
<p>2. <strong>NLMs use embeddings</strong> (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) → Words with similar meanings have <strong>similar vector representations</strong>, reducing sparsity.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Neural networks learn meaningful word relationships</strong> → Instead of storing <strong>individual word probabilities</strong>, they learn patterns from <strong>contextual similarity</strong>.</p>
<h3>Why Not the Other Options?</h3>
<p>* <strong>Smoothing techniques</strong> are used in <strong>statistical models (e.g., N-grams)</strong> but not in neural models.</p>
<p>* <strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)</strong> help with sequential data but don’t directly solve sparsity.</p>
<p>* <strong>"All of the above" is incorrect</strong> because early NLMs mainly relied on embeddings, not smoothing.</p>
<p>Thus, <strong>word embeddings revolutionized language modeling</strong> by overcoming the sparsity issue and improving generalization.</p>

<h2>54,What is a key characteristic of pre-trained language models (PLMs)?,Task-specific training,Task-agnostic training,Limited data requirements,All of the above,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p><strong>Task-agnostic training</strong></p>
<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p><strong>Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs)</strong> are trained on <strong>large-scale corpora</strong> in a <strong>task-agnostic</strong> manner, meaning they are not limited to a specific task during training. Instead, they learn <strong>general language representations</strong>, which can later be fine-tuned for specific tasks like translation, summarization, or question answering.</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>1. <strong>Task-agnostic training</strong> → PLMs learn general linguistic knowledge from massive datasets before fine-tuning for specific applications.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Not task-specific training</strong> → Unlike traditional models trained for one task, PLMs can adapt to multiple tasks via fine-tuning.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Not limited data requirements</strong> → PLMs require massive amounts of text data for effective pre-training.</p>
<p>Thus, <strong>PLMs are designed to be task-agnostic during pre-training, making them highly adaptable across various NLP tasks</strong>.</p>

<h2>55,What architecture revolutionized the development of neural language models?,Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs),Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),Transformers,Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs),</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p><strong>Transformers</strong></p>
<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>The <strong>Transformer architecture</strong>, introduced in the paper *"Attention Is All You Need"* (Vaswani et al., 2017), revolutionized neural language models by replacing sequential models like <strong>RNNs and LSTMs</strong> with a fully <strong>attention-based mechanism</strong>. This allowed for <strong>parallel processing</strong>, making training more efficient and improving performance on large-scale text data.</p>
<h3>Why Not the Other Options?</h3>
<p>* <strong>RNNs</strong>: Limited by sequential processing, making them slow and inefficient for long sequences.</p>
<p>* <strong>LSTMs</strong>: Improved upon RNNs with better long-term dependencies but still suffered from sequential processing limitations.</p>
<p>* <strong>CNNs</strong>: Effective in capturing <strong>local patterns</strong>, but not ideal for long-range dependencies in text.</p>
<h3>Key Benefits of Transformers:</h3>
<p>✅ <strong>Self-attention</strong> → Models long-range dependencies efficiently.</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Parallelization</strong> → Enables faster training on large datasets.</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Scalability</strong> → Used in large models like <strong>BERT, GPT, T5, and PaLM</strong>.</p>

<h2>56,Which type of LLM architecture is primarily used for language understanding tasks?,Decoder-only,Encoder-only,Encoder-decoder,Both Decoder-only and Encoder-only,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p><strong>Encoder-only</strong></p>
<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p>Encoder-only architectures, such as <strong>BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)</strong>, are primarily used for <strong>language understanding tasks</strong> like:</p>
<p>* <strong>Text classification</strong></p>
<p>* <strong>Named entity recognition (NER)</strong></p>
<p>* <strong>Sentiment analysis</strong></p>
<p>* <strong>Question answering</strong> (extractive)</p>
<h3>Why Encoder-only?</h3>
<p>✅ <strong>Bidirectional Context:</strong> Encoder models process input text <strong>in both directions (left and right context)</strong>, making them well-suited for understanding meaning and relationships between words.</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Strong Representations:</strong> They generate <strong>rich contextual embeddings</strong> for downstream tasks.</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Pretraining on MLM (Masked Language Modeling):</strong> This helps the model learn deep <strong>semantic representations</strong>.</p>
<h3>Why Not Other Architectures?</h3>
<p>* <strong>Decoder-only (e.g., GPT-3, LLaMA):</strong> Optimized for <strong>language generation</strong>, not understanding.</p>
<p>* <strong>Encoder-Decoder (e.g., T5, BART):</strong> Best for <strong>seq-to-seq tasks</strong> like translation and summarization, not pure understanding.</p>
<p>* <strong>Both Encoder-only and Decoder-only:</strong> Not entirely correct because <strong>decoder-only models focus on generation, not understanding.</strong></p>
<h3>Final Answer: <strong>Encoder-only models</strong> are best suited for <strong>language understanding</strong> tasks.</h3>

<h2>60,What is "masked language modeling" in the context of LLM pre-training?,Predicting the next word in a sequence,Predicting masked words based on context,Generating creative text,Translating languages,Predicting masked words based on context,LLM Training</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p><strong>Predicting masked words based on context</strong></p>
<h3>Explanation:</h3>
<p><strong>Masked Language Modeling (MLM)</strong> is a pre-training objective where some words in a sentence are <strong>randomly masked</strong> (hidden), and the model learns to <strong>predict the masked words</strong> using the surrounding context.</p>
<h4><strong>How it Works:</strong></h4>
<p>* A certain percentage of words in the input sentence are replaced with a special token (e.g., `[MASK]` in BERT).</p>
<p>* The model is trained to predict the <strong>original words</strong> based on the context from both the left and right sides.</p>
<h4><strong>Example:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> "The cat sat on the <strong>\[MASK]</strong>."</p>
<p><strong>Model Prediction:</strong> "mat"</p>
<h3><strong>Why is MLM Important?</strong></h3>
<p>✅ <strong>Bidirectional Understanding:</strong> Unlike autoregressive models (which predict the next word), MLM allows the model to <strong>understand context from both sides</strong>.</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Stronger Representations:</strong> Helps models like <strong>BERT</strong> learn <strong>deep contextual embeddings</strong> useful for NLP tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis, question answering).</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Better Generalization:</strong> Since the model is trained to <strong>recover missing words</strong>, it develops a <strong>robust understanding</strong> of language.</p>
<h3><strong>Which Models Use MLM?</strong></h3>
<p>* <strong>BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)</strong></p>
<p>* <strong>RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT)</strong></p>

<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p><strong>Learn from a small set of examples in the prompt</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Explanation:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>In-Context Learning (ICL)</strong> is the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to <strong>learn from examples provided within a prompt</strong> <strong>without modifying the model's parameters</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>How it Works:</strong></h4>
<p>* Instead of fine-tuning on a dataset, the model <strong>adapts on the fly</strong> based on <strong>few-shot examples</strong> in the input.</p>
<p>* The model uses <strong>pattern recognition</strong> to generalize from these examples and <strong>generate relevant responses</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>Example:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p>
<p>*"Translate the following English sentences into French:*</p>
<p>1. <strong>The cat is sleeping</strong> → *Le chat dort*</p>
<p>2. <strong>The sun is shining</strong> → ???"</p>
<p><strong>Model Output:</strong></p>
<p>*"Le soleil brille"*</p>
<h3><strong>Why is In-Context Learning Important?</strong></h3>
<p>✅ <strong>No need for parameter updates:</strong> The model does not require re-training to adapt to new tasks.</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Efficient and flexible:</strong> Works for multiple tasks without explicitly training on them.</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Used in GPT models:</strong> OpenAI's <strong>GPT-3 and GPT-4</strong> leverage in-context learning to <strong>adapt quickly to user instructions</strong>.</p>

<p>✅ <strong>Self-attention mechanism</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Explanation:</strong></h3>
<p>Transformer-based models <strong>rely heavily on self-attention</strong> to process input sequences efficiently. Unlike earlier architectures like RNNs and CNNs, transformers <strong>do not require recurrence or fixed input sizes</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Characteristics of Transformer Models:</strong></h4>
<p>1. <strong>Self-Attention Mechanism:</strong></p>
<p>   * Enables the model to <strong>weigh the importance of different words</strong> in a sequence, regardless of their position.</p>
<p>   * Allows <strong>parallel processing</strong>, making transformers <strong>more efficient</strong> than RNNs.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Positional Encoding:</strong></p>
<p>   * Since transformers <strong>do not process data sequentially</strong>, they use <strong>positional encoding</strong> to maintain order information.</p>

<h2>104,Which process reduces data sparsity in early neural language models?,Embedding words into vectors,Using n-grams,Applying smoothing,Data augmentation,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Embedding words into vectors</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Explanation:</strong></h3>
<p>Early neural language models <strong>suffered from data sparsity</strong> because they relied on discrete word representations, where each word had a unique ID, leading to a massive vocabulary with many unseen words.</p>
<p><strong>Word embeddings</strong> (such as Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText) helped address this by:</p>
<p>* <strong>Mapping words into dense, low-dimensional vector spaces</strong> instead of one-hot encoding.</p>
<p>* <strong>Capturing semantic relationships</strong> between words (e.g., "king" and "queen" have similar vector structures).</p>
<p>* <strong>Reducing sparsity</strong>, allowing models to generalize better even with limited data.</p>
<h4><strong>Why not the other options?</strong></h4>
<p>❌ <strong>Using n-grams</strong> – N-grams suffer from sparsity issues, especially for large vocabularies.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>Applying smoothing</strong> – Smoothing helps in <strong>probabilistic language models</strong> but is not the primary solution for neural models.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>Data augmentation</strong> – While it can help in some cases, it is not the main method for reducing data sparsity in early neural models.</p>

<p>✅ <strong>Abilities that arise at scale</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Explanation:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Emergent abilities</strong> in Large Language Models (LLMs) refer to <strong>new capabilities that only appear when a model reaches a certain scale</strong> in terms of <strong>parameters, data, and computation</strong>. These abilities are <strong>not explicitly programmed</strong> but emerge as a result of the complex interactions within the model.</p>
<h4><strong>Examples of Emergent Abilities:</strong></h4>
<p>* <strong>In-context learning</strong> (learning from a prompt without additional training)</p>
<p>* <strong>Better reasoning and few-shot learning</strong></p>
<p>* <strong>Understanding and following complex instructions</strong></p>
<p>* <strong>Multi-step problem-solving</strong></p>
<h4><strong>Why not the other options?</strong></h4>
<p>❌ <strong>Abilities present in all models</strong> – Smaller models often lack emergent abilities; they only appear at <strong>large scales</strong>.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>Abilities unique to small models</strong> – The opposite is true; emergent abilities are observed in <strong>larger models</strong>.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>Abilities specific to GPT-4</strong> – Emergent abilities are observed in <strong>many LLMs</strong>, not just GPT-4 (e.g., GPT-3, PaLM, LLaMA).</p>

<h2>109,What technique allows LLMs to perform new tasks during inference?,Data augmentation,Chain-of-thought prompting,Instruction tuning,In-context learning,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p>✅ <strong>In-context learning</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Explanation:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>In-context learning (ICL)</strong> is a technique that allows <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform new tasks during inference</strong> by <strong>providing a few examples in the input prompt</strong>. The model <strong>does not require fine-tuning</strong>; instead, it generalizes from the examples and generates appropriate responses.</p>
<h4><strong>How In-Context Learning Works:</strong></h4>
<p>1. <strong>User provides a prompt</strong> with examples of the desired task (e.g., translation, summarization, classification).</p>
<p>2. <strong>LLM identifies patterns</strong> from the examples.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Model generates a response</strong> for new inputs based on the learned pattern.</p>
<h4><strong>Example of In-Context Learning:</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Prompt:</strong></p>
<p>*"Translate the following English sentences to French."*</p>
<p>* <strong>Example 1:</strong> "Hello" → "Bonjour"</p>
<p>* <strong>Example 2:</strong> "Good morning" → "Bonjour"</p>
<p>* <strong>New input:</strong> "How are you?" → *(LLM infers the correct translation: "Comment ça va?")*</p>
<h4><strong>Why not the other options?</strong></h4>
<p>❌ <strong>Data augmentation</strong> – Involves expanding a dataset using transformations, but it’s used <strong>during training, not inference</strong>.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>Chain-of-thought prompting</strong> – Helps with <strong>multi-step reasoning</strong>, but <strong>does not enable task learning itself</strong>.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>Instruction tuning</strong> – Involves <strong>fine-tuning</strong> a model on instructions but requires additional training, whereas <strong>ICL works at inference time</strong>.</p>

<h2>110,What problem do n-gram models face?,Limited vocabulary,Data sparsity,Overfitting,High computation cost,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Data sparsity</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Explanation:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>N-gram models</strong> estimate the probability of a word given its previous words. However, they suffer from <strong>data sparsity</strong>, meaning they struggle when encountering unseen or rare word sequences.</p>
<h4><strong>Why is data sparsity a problem?</strong></h4>
<p>1. <strong>Limited Training Data</strong> – There are countless possible word combinations, but a dataset only contains a small fraction of them.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Zero Probability Issue</strong> – If a word sequence is <strong>absent from the training data</strong>, the model assigns it a <strong>zero probability</strong>, making it ineffective for real-world language modeling.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Poor Generalization</strong> – Since n-grams rely on exact word sequences, they fail to generalize beyond what they have seen.</p>
<h4><strong>Why not the other options?</strong></h4>
<p>❌ <strong>Limited vocabulary</strong> – While n-gram models can have a fixed vocabulary, the real issue is handling <strong>rare or unseen sequences</strong>, not just vocabulary size.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>Overfitting</strong> – N-grams usually underfit rather than overfit because they don't learn deep patterns—just word co-occurrences.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>High computation cost</strong> – N-gram models are computationally simpler than neural models like transformers. The main challenge is <strong>storing large n-gram tables</strong>, not computation itself.</p>

<h2>111,How are embeddings used in NLP?,To map words into fixed probabilities,To reduce dimensionality,To represent words in continuous space,To improve grammar checking,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p>✅ <strong>To represent words in continuous space</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Explanation:</strong></h3>
<p>Embeddings are <strong>dense vector representations</strong> of words, phrases, or sentences in a continuous space. Instead of using <strong>one-hot encoding</strong> (which is sparse and high-dimensional), embeddings <strong>capture semantic relationships</strong> between words by placing similar words closer together in a multi-dimensional space.</p>
<h4><strong>Why are embeddings important?</strong></h4>
<p>* <strong>They capture meaning</strong> – Similar words (e.g., "king" and "queen") have similar vector representations.</p>
<p>* <strong>They handle synonyms better</strong> – Unlike one-hot encoding, embeddings recognize words with similar meanings.</p>
<p>* <strong>They reduce sparsity</strong> – Since they are low-dimensional, embeddings avoid the sparsity issue seen in traditional word representations.</p>
<h4><strong>Why not the other options?</strong></h4>
<p>❌ <strong>To map words into fixed probabilities</strong> – Embeddings <strong>do not assign probabilities</strong>; they provide vector representations instead.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>To reduce dimensionality</strong> – While embeddings often use <strong>lower-dimensional representations</strong>, their primary purpose is <strong>capturing relationships between words</strong>, not just reducing dimensions.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>To improve grammar checking</strong> – Grammar checking may use embeddings indirectly, but embeddings <strong>primarily represent words</strong> in a way that captures meaning and context.</p>

<h2>112,What is a common evaluation metric for LLMs?,BLEU,Precision\@N,NDCG,All of the above,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p>✅ <strong>All of the above</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Explanation:</strong></h3>
<p>Different evaluation metrics are used for Large Language Models (LLMs), depending on the specific task:</p>
<p>1. <strong>BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)</strong> – Used for evaluating <strong>machine translation</strong> by comparing generated text to reference translations.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Precision\@N</strong> – Commonly used in <strong>recommendation systems</strong> and <strong>retrieval tasks</strong> to measure how many of the top-N retrieved results are relevant.</p>
<p>3. <strong>NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)</strong> – Used in <strong>ranking tasks</strong> to measure how well a model ranks relevant results.</p>
<p>Since LLMs are used in various tasks (e.g., text generation, ranking, recommendation), all these metrics can be used to evaluate different aspects of their performance.</p>

<h2>113,What dataset type is typically used for fine-tuning PLMs?,Labeled task-specific data,Unlabeled web data,High-dimensional images,Annotated videos,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Labeled task-specific data</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Explanation:</strong></h3>
<p>Fine-tuning Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) typically requires <strong>labeled task-specific data</strong> because:</p>
<p>* <strong>PLMs are pre-trained on large amounts of unlabeled text</strong> (e.g., web data, books, Wikipedia) using self-supervised learning.</p>
<p>* <strong>Fine-tuning involves training on specific tasks</strong> (e.g., sentiment analysis, question answering, summarization) using <strong>labeled datasets</strong> with input-output pairs.</p>
<h3><strong>Why not the other options?</strong></h3>
<p>❌ <strong>Unlabeled web data</strong> → Used during pre-training, not fine-tuning.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>High-dimensional images</strong> → PLMs focus on text, not images.</p>

<h2>114,Which component allows transformers to process input in parallel?,Feed-forward layers,Attention mechanism,Recurrent layers,Pooling layers,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Attention mechanism</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Explanation:</strong></h3>
<p>Transformers process input <strong>in parallel</strong> due to their <strong>self-attention mechanism</strong>, which allows them to:</p>
<p>* Attend to <strong>all words in a sequence simultaneously</strong>, rather than sequentially (like RNNs).</p>
<p>* Compute relationships between words in a <strong>single step</strong>, making processing <strong>faster and more efficient</strong>.</p>
<p>* Enable scalability for large datasets and models like GPT, BERT, and T5.</p>
<h3><strong>Why not the other options?</strong></h3>
<p>❌ <strong>Feed-forward layers</strong> → Process data independently but do not handle dependencies between words.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>Recurrent layers</strong> → Found in RNNs/LSTMs, which process input <strong>sequentially</strong>, not in parallel.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>Pooling layers</strong> → Used in CNNs, not transformers, and do not contribute to parallel processing.</p>

<h2>115,What is a chain-of-thought prompt used for?,Training new models,Improving embeddings,Breaking down reasoning steps,Enhancing tokenization,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p>✅ <strong>Breaking down reasoning steps</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Explanation:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting</strong> helps <strong>LLMs improve reasoning</strong> by guiding them to <strong>explicitly break down complex problems</strong> into intermediate steps before reaching a final answer.</p>
<p>* Useful for <strong>math problems, logical reasoning, and multi-step tasks</strong>.</p>
<p>* Helps <strong>reduce errors</strong> by encouraging a <strong>structured thought process</strong>.</p>
<p>* Example: Instead of directly answering <strong>"What is 23 × 17?"</strong>, the model breaks it down:</p>
<p>  *"23 × 10 = 230, 23 × 7 = 161, so 230 + 161 = 391."*</p>
<h3><strong>Why not the other options?</strong></h3>
<p>❌ <strong>Training new models</strong> → CoT is a <strong>prompting</strong> method, not a training technique.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>Improving embeddings</strong> → Embeddings map words into vector space, unrelated to reasoning breakdown.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>Enhancing tokenization</strong> → Tokenization breaks text into units (words/subwords), not reasoning steps.</p>

<h2>116,What is the purpose of smoothing in n-gram models?,To handle unseen n-grams,To reduce model size,To increase training speed,To enhance embeddings,</h2>
<p>The correct answer is:</p>
<p>✅ <strong>To handle unseen n-grams</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Explanation:</strong></h3>
<p>Smoothing techniques are used in <strong>n-gram language models</strong> to <strong>assign probabilities to unseen n-grams</strong> (word sequences) that were <strong>not encountered in the training data</strong>. This helps prevent <strong>zero probability issues</strong> and improves generalization.</p>
<h3><strong>Common Smoothing Techniques:</strong></h3>
<p>* <strong>Laplace Smoothing (Add-1 Smoothing):</strong> Adds a small constant to all counts to avoid zero probabilities.</p>
<p>* <strong>Add-k Smoothing:</strong> Similar to Laplace but with a tunable constant *k*.</p>
<p>* <strong>Kneser-Ney Smoothing:</strong> More advanced; redistributes probability mass based on word frequency.</p>
<h3><strong>Why not the other options?</strong></h3>
<p>❌ <strong>To reduce model size</strong> → Smoothing does not shrink models; it adjusts probability estimates.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>To increase training speed</strong> → It actually adds computation, slightly slowing down training.</p>
<p>❌ <strong>To enhance embeddings</strong> → Smoothing is for probability estimation, not word embeddings.</p>

<h3><strong>Explanation:</strong></h3>
<p>Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) <strong>revolutionized NLP</strong> by introducing a <strong>generalized embedding space</strong>, allowing models to learn <strong>rich contextual representations</strong> from large-scale text before fine-tuning on specific tasks.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Contributions of PLMs:</strong></h3>
<p>* <strong>Generalized Representations:</strong> Unlike earlier models, PLMs <strong>capture deep contextual meaning</strong> across different tasks.</p>
<p>* <strong>Transfer Learning:</strong> Once pre-trained, they can be <strong>fine-tuned</strong> on specific tasks, reducing the need for task-specific training from scratch.</p>
<p>* <strong>Improved Performance:</strong> Achieve <strong>better accuracy</strong> across diverse NLP applications (translation, summarization, sentiment analysis, etc.).</p>

<h2>130,What allows embeddings to compute semantic similarity?,Their dimensionality,Their training method,Their hidden space,Their task-specific tuning,</h2>
<p>✅ <strong>Their training method</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Explanation:</strong></h3>
<p>Embeddings compute semantic similarity based on how they are <strong>trained</strong>. Specifically, embeddings are trained to map words or phrases into continuous vector spaces where semantically similar words are represented by vectors that are closer together. The <strong>training method</strong> is crucial in determining the relationships between words in this vector space. Common techniques like <strong>Word2Vec</strong>, <strong>GloVe</strong>, or <strong>transformer-based models</strong> (e.g., BERT) learn these embeddings from large text corpora, capturing semantic meaning by minimizing a loss function that encourages semantically related words to have similar representations.</p>
<h4><strong>Why not the others?</strong></h4>
<p>* <strong>Dimensionality</strong>: While dimensionality affects the representational power, it's the <strong>training method</strong> that determines how well embeddings capture semantic similarity.</p>
<p>* <strong>Hidden space</strong>: The hidden space refers to the internal representation in the model but doesn't directly compute similarity in the way training methods do.</p>
<p>* <strong>Task-specific tuning</strong>: While tuning can refine embeddings for a specific task, it is the <strong>training method</strong> that generally determines how semantic similarity is captured in embeddings.</p>

<h3><strong>How RTD Works:</strong></h3>
<p>1. A <strong>generator model</strong> (small masked language model) <strong>replaces some tokens</strong> in the input sequence.</p>
<p>2. The <strong>discriminator model</strong> (main model) is trained to <strong>detect whether each token is original or replaced</strong>.</p>
<p>3. The model learns <strong>better representations</strong> without needing large masked tokens like in BERT, making it more <strong>data-efficient</strong> and <strong>faster to train</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Comparison with Other Techniques:</strong></h3>
<p>* <strong>Masked Language Modeling (MLM):</strong> Used in <strong>BERT</strong> (predicts missing tokens).</p>
<p>* <strong>Next Sentence Prediction (NSP):</strong> Used in <strong>BERT</strong> (predicts if two sentences are related).</p>
<p>* <strong>Sequence-to-Sequence Prediction:</strong> Used in <strong>T5, BART</strong> (useful for translation, summarization).</p>

<p>2. The model is trained to <strong>predict the masked words</strong> based on the surrounding context.</p>
<p>3. This allows BERT to <strong>learn deep bidirectional representations</strong> rather than just left-to-right (like GPT) or right-to-left processing.</p>
<h3><strong>Comparison with Other Models:</strong></h3>
<p>* <strong>GPT:</strong> Uses <strong>causal language modeling</strong> (predicts the next token without masking).</p>
<p>* <strong>ELECTRA:</strong> Uses <strong>Replaced Token Detection (RTD)</strong> instead of MLM.</p>
<p>* <strong>RoBERTa:</strong> Improves upon BERT’s MLM by removing Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) and training with more data.</p>
<p>Since <strong>BERT pioneered MLM</strong>, it is the correct answer.</p>

<h2>185,Which variant of BERT focuses on reducing memory consumption?,RoBERTa,ELECTRA,ALBERT,XLNet,</h2>
<p>✅ <strong>ALBERT (A Lite BERT)</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Explanation:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>ALBERT (A Lite BERT)</strong> is a <strong>variant of BERT</strong> designed to <strong>reduce memory consumption</strong> and <strong>improve efficiency</strong> while maintaining performance.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Improvements in ALBERT:</strong></h3>
<p>1. <strong>Parameter Reduction Techniques:</strong></p>
<p>   * <strong>Factorized Embedding Parameterization</strong>: Reduces the size of embeddings to <strong>improve efficiency</strong>.</p>
<p>   * <strong>Cross-layer Parameter Sharing</strong>: <strong>Reuses parameters across layers</strong>, significantly lowering the number of trainable parameters.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Memory Efficiency:</strong></p>
<p>   * Uses <strong>fewer parameters than BERT</strong>, making it <strong>lighter and faster</strong> for training and inference.</p>
<p>   * <strong>Lower GPU memory requirement</strong>, enabling better scalability.</p>
<h3><strong>Comparison with Other Models:</strong></h3>
<p>* <strong>RoBERTa</strong>: Focuses on improving training strategies (e.g., <strong>longer training and more data</strong>), but does <strong>not</strong> focus on memory efficiency.</p>
<p>* <strong>ELECTRA</strong>: Uses <strong>Replaced Token Detection (RTD)</strong> instead of Masked Language Modeling (MLM) but doesn’t significantly optimize memory usage.</p>
<p>* <strong>XLNet</strong>: Uses <strong>permutation-based training</strong> for bidirectional context but is computationally expensive.</p>
<p>Since <strong>ALBERT focuses on memory efficiency and reduced parameter size</strong>, it is the correct answer.</p>

<h2>186,What mechanism does DeBERTa use to represent each word?,Context and content vectors,Disentangled attention,Relative position encoding,Mask decoding,</h2>
<p>✅ <strong>Disentangled attention</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Explanation:</strong></h3>
<p>DeBERTa (<strong>Decoding-enhanced BERT with Disentangled Attention</strong>) improves upon BERT and RoBERTa by introducing <strong>disentangled attention</strong> and <strong>relative position encoding</strong> for better contextual understanding.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Features of DeBERTa:</strong></h3>
<p>1. <strong>Disentangled Attention Mechanism:</strong></p>
<p>   * Unlike BERT, which treats <strong>word embeddings</strong> as single vectors, DeBERTa <strong>separates content embeddings and position embeddings</strong>.</p>
<p>   * This allows the model to <strong>better capture word relationships</strong> based on both <strong>semantic meaning</strong> and <strong>word position</strong>.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Relative Position Encoding:</strong></p>
<p>   * Instead of using absolute position embeddings (like BERT), DeBERTa employs <strong>relative position embeddings</strong> to improve language modeling, especially for <strong>long sequences</strong>.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Better Performance:</strong></p>
<p>   * Outperforms BERT and RoBERTa in <strong>many NLP tasks</strong>, including <strong>GLUE, SuperGLUE, and SQuAD benchmarks</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Comparison with Other Mechanisms:</strong></h3>
<p>* <strong>Context and content vectors</strong> → Not a specific feature of DeBERTa.</p>
<p>* <strong>Relative position encoding</strong> → Used in DeBERTa, but <strong>not the core distinguishing feature</strong>.</p>
<p>* <strong>Mask decoding</strong> → More related to models like <strong>BART</strong>, which focus on sequence-to-sequence tasks.</p>
<p>Since <strong>disentangled attention is the key innovation of DeBERTa</strong>, it is the correct answer.</p>

<h2>187,Which model applies the autoregressive method for bidirectional context learning?,RoBERTa,XLNet,ALBERT,UNILM,</h2>
<p>✅ <strong>XLNet</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Explanation:</strong></h3>
<p>XLNet is a transformer-based model that applies the <strong>autoregressive (AR) method</strong> while capturing <strong>bidirectional context</strong>, making it different from BERT and other standard transformers.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Features of XLNet:</strong></h3>
<p>1. <strong>Autoregressive Pretraining:</strong></p>
<p>   * Unlike BERT, which uses <strong>masked language modeling (MLM)</strong>, XLNet <strong>predicts words autoregressively</strong>, processing sequences in <strong>permuted orders</strong> instead of left-to-right like GPT.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Bidirectional Context Learning:</strong></p>
<p>   * Unlike traditional autoregressive models (e.g., GPT, which processes tokens sequentially), XLNet uses <strong>permutation-based training</strong> to capture <strong>context from both directions</strong> while maintaining autoregressive generation.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Overcoming BERT’s Limitations:</strong></p>
<p>   * BERT’s <strong>MLM training corrupts input data</strong> by replacing words with \[MASK] tokens, which causes a gap between pretraining and fine-tuning.</p>
<p>   * XLNet avoids this by learning without input corruption, making it <strong>better at language modeling tasks</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Comparison with Other Models:</strong></h3>
<p>* <strong>RoBERTa</strong> → An optimized version of BERT, <strong>not autoregressive</strong>.</p>
<p>* <strong>ALBERT</strong> → A memory-efficient variant of BERT, <strong>not autoregressive</strong>.</p>
<p>* <strong>UNILM</strong> → Supports both <strong>unidirectional and bidirectional modeling</strong>, but does not use <strong>permutation-based autoregression</strong> like XLNet.</p>
<p>Since <strong>XLNet uniquely combines autoregression with bidirectional learning</strong>, it is the correct answer.</p>

<h2>198,What is the key innovation in RoBERTa compared to BERT?,New language tasks,Modified hyperparameters and training strategies,Masked sequence pre-training,Bidirectional training,Modified hyperparameters and training strategies,Pre-trained LLMs</h2>
<p>✅ <strong>Modified hyperparameters and training strategies</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Explanation:</strong></h3>
<p>RoBERTa (<strong>Robustly Optimized BERT Approach</strong>) is an improved version of BERT that <strong>modifies its training strategies and hyperparameters</strong> to enhance performance.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Innovations in RoBERTa:</strong></h3>
<p>1. <strong>Longer Training with More Data</strong></p>
<p>   * RoBERTa is trained on <strong>more data</strong> and for <strong>longer epochs</strong> compared to BERT.</p>
<p>   * It removes <strong>Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)</strong>, which was part of BERT's training, leading to better performance.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Larger Batch Sizes & Learning Rates</strong></p>
<p>   * RoBERTa uses <strong>bigger batch sizes</strong> and <strong>optimized learning rates</strong>, making training more effective.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Dynamic Masking for MLM (Masked Language Modeling)</strong></p>
<p>   * Unlike BERT, which <strong>masks tokens once and reuses the same masked dataset</strong>, RoBERTa <strong>dynamically remasks tokens</strong> for better generalization.</p>
<p>4. <strong>More Pretraining Data</strong></p>
<p>   * It is trained on datasets <strong>10x larger</strong> than BERT (160GB of text instead of 16GB), improving its ability to understand language.</p>
<h3><strong>Why Other Options Are Incorrect:</strong></h3>
<p>* <strong>New language tasks</strong> → RoBERTa <strong>does not introduce new tasks</strong>; it only modifies how existing tasks are trained.</p>
<p>* <strong>Masked sequence pre-training</strong> → Both <strong>BERT and RoBERTa use MLM</strong>, so this is <strong>not unique</strong> to RoBERTa.</p>
<p>* <strong>Bidirectional training</strong> → BERT <strong>already</strong> uses bidirectional attention, so this is <strong>not a new feature</strong> in RoBERTa.</p>
<p>* <strong>Pre-trained LLMs</strong> → This applies to <strong>many models</strong>, not specifically RoBERTa.</p>
<p>Thus, the correct answer is <strong>Modified hyperparameters and training strategies</strong>.</p>

<h2>199,Which of the following uses disentangled attention mechanisms?,GPT,BERT,DeBERTa,XLNet,DeBERTa,Pre-trained LLMs</h2>
<p>✅ <strong>DeBERTa</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Explanation:</strong></h3>
<p>DeBERTa (<strong>Decoding-enhanced BERT with Disentangled Attention</strong>) introduces <strong>disentangled attention mechanisms</strong>, which improve the way it understands word relationships in a sentence.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Features of DeBERTa:</strong></h3>
<p>1. <strong>Disentangled Attention Mechanism</strong></p>
<p>   * Unlike <strong>BERT</strong>, which treats all tokens in the same way, DeBERTa <strong>separates content and positional information</strong> when computing attention scores.</p>
<p>   * This helps <strong>better model word meanings</strong> and <strong>improve generalization</strong>.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Enhanced Relative Position Encoding</strong></p>
<p>   * Unlike <strong>BERT</strong>, DeBERTa <strong>incorporates relative positions more effectively</strong> to capture long-range dependencies.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Better Performance than BERT & RoBERTa</strong></p>
<p>   * DeBERTa outperforms <strong>BERT</strong> and <strong>RoBERTa</strong> on NLP benchmarks like <strong>GLUE, SQuAD, and SuperGLUE</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Why Other Options Are Incorrect:</strong></h3>
<p>* <strong>GPT</strong> → Uses a standard <strong>transformer decoder</strong> without disentangled attention.</p>
<p>* <strong>BERT</strong> → Uses <strong>standard self-attention</strong>, not disentangled attention.</p>
<p>* <strong>XLNet</strong> → Uses a <strong>permutation-based autoregressive model</strong>, not disentangled attention.</p>
<p>* <strong>Pre-trained LLMs</strong> → This is <strong>too broad</strong> and does not specifically refer to disentangled attention.</p>

<h2>200,What task is NOT used in UNILM training?,Unidirectional modeling,Bidirectional modeling,Next sentence prediction,Sequence-to-sequence prediction,</h2>
<p>✅ <strong>Next sentence prediction</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Explanation:</strong></h3>
<p>UNILM (<strong>Unified Language Model</strong>) is designed to handle <strong>multiple types of language modeling tasks</strong>, but it does <strong>not use Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Training Tasks in UNILM:</strong></h3>
<p>1. <strong>Unidirectional Modeling</strong> → Similar to GPT, where words are predicted <strong>from left to right</strong>.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Bidirectional Modeling</strong> → Similar to BERT, where the model <strong>looks at both left and right contexts</strong>.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Sequence-to-Sequence Prediction</strong> → Similar to T5, useful for <strong>text generation, translation, and summarization</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Why NSP Is NOT Used in UNILM?</strong></h3>
<p>* BERT uses <strong>NSP</strong> to improve <strong>sentence relationship understanding</strong>, but UNILM focuses on <strong>multi-task learning</strong> with different attention masks.</p>
<p>* Instead of NSP, <strong>UNILM relies on its sequence-to-sequence objective</strong> for tasks like text generation.</p>
<h3><strong>Why Other Options Are Incorrect?</strong></h3>
<p>* <strong>Unidirectional Modeling</strong> → Used in UNILM for autoregressive tasks.</p>
<p>* <strong>Bidirectional Modeling</strong> → Used in UNILM for deep context understanding.</p>

<h2>202,What is the pre-training objective of ELECTRA?,Predict masked tokens,Replaced token detection,Next token prediction,Sequence-to-sequence modeling,</h2>
<p>✅ <strong>Replaced Token Detection</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Explanation:</strong></h3>
<p>ELECTRA (<strong>Efficiently Learning an Encoder that Classifies Token Replacements Accurately</strong>) introduces <strong>Replaced Token Detection (RTD)</strong> as its <strong>pre-training objective</strong> instead of <strong>Masked Language Modeling (MLM)</strong> used in BERT.</p>
<h3><strong>How Replaced Token Detection Works?</strong></h3>
<p>1. Instead of masking tokens like BERT, <strong>ELECTRA replaces some tokens with plausible alternatives</strong> generated by a small generator model.</p>
<p>2. The main model (<strong>discriminator</strong>) is trained to <strong>detect whether each token was replaced or not</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Why RTD Instead of MLM?</strong></h3>
<p>* <strong>More efficient training</strong> → RTD forces the model to learn from <strong>all input tokens</strong> instead of only masked tokens (MLM learns from \~15% of tokens).</p>
<p>* <strong>Improves performance</strong> → ELECTRA achieves better accuracy than BERT with <strong>less computational cost</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Why Other Options Are Incorrect?</strong></h3>
<p>* <strong>Predict masked tokens</strong> → Used in <strong>BERT, RoBERTa</strong> (not ELECTRA).</p>
<p>* <strong>Next token prediction</strong> → Used in <strong>GPT models</strong> (ELECTRA does not predict next tokens).</p>
<p>* <strong>Sequence-to-sequence modeling</strong> → Used in <strong>T5, BART</strong> for text generation (ELECTRA is not sequence-to-sequence).</p>
<p>Thus, the correct answer is <strong>Replaced Token Detection</strong>.</p>

<div class="question" id="question203">
<h2>203,Which model primarily uses text-to-text generation for all tasks?,RoBERTa,T5,GPT,BART,</h2>
<p>✅ <strong>T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Explanation:</strong></h3>
<p>T5 (<strong>Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer</strong>) is designed to handle <strong>all NLP tasks in a unified "text-to-text" format</strong>. This means:</p>
<p>* <strong>Input and output are always text</strong> (e.g., translation, summarization, question answering, classification, etc.).</p>
<p>* No need for task-specific architectures—just fine-tune on labeled data with a <strong>simple text input-output format</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Why T5?</strong></h3>
<p>* Unlike BERT or GPT, T5 <strong>converts every task into a sequence-to-sequence problem</strong>.</p>
<p>* Example:</p>
<p>  * <strong>Summarization:</strong> *"summarize: The book was very interesting..." → "It was engaging."*</p>
<p>  * <strong>Translation:</strong> *"translate English to French: How are you?" → "Comment ça va?"*</p>
<p>  * <strong>Sentiment Analysis:</strong> *"classify sentiment: This movie was great!" → "Positive"*</p>
<h3><strong>Why Other Options Are Incorrect?</strong></h3>
<p>* <strong>RoBERTa</strong> → A refined <strong>BERT-based encoder</strong>, not a sequence-to-sequence model.</p>
<p>* <strong>GPT</strong> → <strong>Autoregressive model</strong> trained for next-token prediction, mainly for <strong>text generation</strong>, but not task-agnostic text-to-text like T5.</p>
<p>* <strong>BART</strong> → Uses <strong>encoder-decoder</strong> architecture like T5, but is optimized for <strong>denoising autoencoding tasks</strong>, not a general-purpose text-to-text framework.</p>
<p>Thus, the correct answer is <strong>T5</strong>.</p>

<h2>211,Are Transformers more efficient than RNNs?,Yes,No,</h2>
<p>✅ <strong>Yes</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Why Are Transformers More Efficient Than RNNs?</strong></h3>
<p>Transformers outperform RNNs in several ways:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Parallelization</strong></p>
<p>   * <strong>RNNs</strong> process sequences <strong>one token at a time</strong>, making them <strong>slow</strong> for long texts.</p>
<p>   * <strong>Transformers</strong> use <strong>self-attention</strong>, allowing them to <strong>process all tokens simultaneously</strong> → <strong>faster training</strong> on GPUs/TPUs.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Long-Range Dependencies</strong></p>
<p>   * <strong>RNNs</strong> struggle with <strong>long-range dependencies</strong> due to <strong>vanishing gradients</strong>.</p>
<p>   * <strong>Transformers</strong> use <strong>attention mechanisms</strong> to <strong>capture global context efficiently</strong>.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Scalability</strong></p>
<p>   * <strong>Transformers</strong> can scale to <strong>billions of parameters</strong> (e.g., GPT-4, PaLM 2) due to their <strong>parallel computing capability</strong>.</p>
<p>   * <strong>RNNs</strong> have memory and computation bottlenecks that limit their scalability.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Memory Efficiency</strong></p>
<p>   * <strong>RNNs</strong> require <strong>storing hidden states</strong> for each step, making them <strong>memory-intensive</strong>.</p>
<p>   * <strong>Transformers</strong> use a <strong>fixed-length attention mechanism</strong>, making memory usage more predictable.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>Transformers are significantly <strong>more efficient</strong> than RNNs for large-scale NLP tasks, making them the foundation of modern <strong>LLMs</strong> like <strong>GPT, BERT, and T5</strong>.</p>

<h3><strong>Why Can RoBERTa Be Used Without Next-Sentence Prediction (NSP)?</strong></h3>
<p>RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) <strong>removes</strong> the Next-Sentence Prediction (NSP) task used in BERT. Instead, it improves performance by:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Training on Longer Sequences</strong></p>
<p>   * RoBERTa <strong>removes NSP</strong> and instead <strong>trains on continuous text sequences</strong>, making it better at understanding longer contexts.</p>
<p>2. <strong>More Data and Training Steps</strong></p>
<p>   * It <strong>trains on more data</strong> for a <strong>longer duration</strong> than BERT, improving performance <strong>without NSP</strong>.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Dynamic Masking</strong></p>
<p>   * Instead of a fixed mask like BERT, RoBERTa applies <strong>different mask patterns</strong> across epochs, improving <strong>masked language modeling (MLM)</strong> effectiveness.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
<p>RoBERTa <strong>does not require NSP</strong> because it achieves <strong>better performance</strong> through <strong>longer training, dynamic masking, and larger datasets</strong>.</p>

<h2>214,Does ELECTRA use masked language modeling?,Yes,No,</h2>
<p>✅ <strong>No</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Why Doesn't ELECTRA Use Masked Language Modeling (MLM)?</strong></h3>
<p>ELECTRA replaces <strong>Masked Language Modeling (MLM)</strong> with a more efficient approach called <strong>Replaced Token Detection (RTD)</strong>.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Differences:</strong></h4>
<p>1. <strong>MLM (Used in BERT, RoBERTa)</strong></p>
<p>   * Randomly <strong>masks</strong> tokens in the input.</p>
<p>   * The model <strong>predicts the masked tokens</strong>.</p>
<p>   * <strong>Inefficient</strong> because the model only learns from <strong>masked tokens (\~15%)</strong>.</p>
<p>2. <strong>RTD (Used in ELECTRA)</strong></p>
<p>   * A <strong>"generator"</strong> first <strong>replaces</strong> some tokens with incorrect ones.</p>
<p>   * A <strong>"discriminator"</strong> then <strong>detects if each token is original or replaced</strong>.</p>
<p>   * More <strong>efficient</strong> because it trains on <strong>all tokens</strong>, not just masked ones.</p>

<h3><strong>Why Aren't All BERT-Based Models Encoder-Only?</strong></h3>
<p>BERT itself is an <strong>encoder-only</strong> model, but some models <strong>inspired by BERT</strong> use different architectures.</p>
<h4><strong>Examples of BERT-Based Models:</strong></h4>
<p>1. <strong>Encoder-Only (Like BERT)</strong></p>
<p>   * <strong>RoBERTa, ALBERT, DeBERTa, ELECTRA (discriminator)</strong></p>
<p>   * Designed for <strong>understanding</strong> text (e.g., classification, QA).</p>
<p>2. <strong>Encoder-Decoder (Not Encoder-Only)</strong></p>
<p>   * <strong>T5, BART, UNILM</strong></p>
<p>   * These models use both <strong>encoder</strong> and <strong>decoder</strong>, making them good for <strong>text generation tasks</strong> (e.g., summarization, translation).</p>
<p>3. <strong>Other Variants</strong></p>
<p>   * <strong>ELECTRA (generator)</strong> uses an <strong>autoregressive-style decoder</strong> to generate token replacements.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Why Does XLNet Use Autoregressive Pre-Training?</strong></h3>
<p>XLNet is an improvement over <strong>BERT</strong> and <strong>GPT</strong>, combining the strengths of <strong>autoregressive</strong> and <strong>autoencoding</strong> methods.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Features of XLNet's Pre-Training:</strong></h4>
<p>1. <strong>Autoregressive Pre-Training:</strong></p>
<p>   * Unlike BERT (which uses Masked Language Modeling), XLNet <strong>predicts tokens sequentially</strong> in a <strong>permuted order</strong>, learning bidirectional context.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Permutation Language Modeling:</strong></p>
<p>   * Instead of masking words (like BERT), XLNet <strong>rearranges token order</strong> randomly and learns to predict them, making it more <strong>flexible and efficient</strong>.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Avoids BERT’s Limitations:</strong></p>
<p>   * BERT assumes <strong>independence</strong> between masked tokens, while XLNet <strong>learns from full sequences</strong> dynamically.</p>

<h2>217,Is T5 designed only for English tasks?,Yes,No,</h2>
<p><strong>No</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Why?</strong></h3>
<p>T5 (<strong>Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer</strong>) is <strong>not limited to English</strong>. While the original T5 was trained primarily on English data (<strong>C4 dataset</strong>), Google introduced <strong>mT5 (Multilingual T5)</strong>, which supports <strong>100+ languages</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Points:</strong></h3>
<p>* <strong>T5</strong> is <strong>English-focused</strong>, but its architecture can be fine-tuned for multilingual tasks.</p>
<p>* <strong>mT5</strong> extends T5’s capabilities to <strong>multiple languages</strong>, making it more versatile.</p>
<p>* Both models follow a <strong>text-to-text framework</strong>, where <strong>all NLP tasks are framed as text generation problems</strong>.</p>

<h2>218,Can BART reconstruct text from corrupted input?,Yes,No,</h2>
<p><strong>Yes</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Why?</strong></h3>
<p>BART (<strong>Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers</strong>) is specifically designed to <strong>reconstruct text from corrupted input</strong> as part of its pre-training.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Mechanisms:</strong></h3>
<p>* <strong>Text Corruption:</strong> BART <strong>intentionally corrupts</strong> input text by <strong>randomly masking, deleting, or permuting words</strong>.</p>
<p>* <strong>Reconstruction:</strong> The model then <strong>learns to reconstruct the original text</strong>, making it effective for <strong>denoising and sequence-to-sequence tasks</strong>.</p>
<p>* <strong>Use Cases:</strong> BART is widely used in <strong>text summarization, translation, and question answering</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h3>
<p>Since BART is <strong>trained to recover missing or shuffled text</strong>, it <strong>can indeed reconstruct text from corrupted input</strong>.</p>

<h2>221,The attention mechanism helps improve parallel computation.,True,False,</h2>
<p><strong>True</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Why?</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>attention mechanism</strong>, especially the <strong>self-attention mechanism</strong> in <strong>Transformers</strong>, improves <strong>parallel computation</strong> by:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Removing Sequential Dependencies</strong>: Unlike RNNs, Transformers process entire sequences simultaneously, making computations <strong>highly parallelizable</strong>.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Enabling Faster Training</strong>: Self-attention computes relationships between all tokens <strong>at once</strong>, allowing <strong>GPUs/TPUs</strong> to accelerate training.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Reducing Long-Term Dependency Issues</strong>: Unlike RNNs, which suffer from vanishing gradients, Transformers use attention to capture <strong>long-range dependencies efficiently</strong>.</p>

<h2>222,BERT introduced the next sentence prediction task.,True,False</h2>
<p><strong>True</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Why?</strong></h3>
<p>BERT introduced the <strong>Next Sentence Prediction (NSP)</strong> task as part of its <strong>pre-training objectives</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>How does NSP work in BERT?</strong></h3>
<p>* The model is given <strong>two sentences (A and B)</strong> and must predict whether B <strong>naturally follows</strong> A.</p>
<p>* Training data is <strong>50% actual sentence pairs</strong> and <strong>50% randomly paired sentences</strong>.</p>
<p>* This helps BERT <strong>understand sentence relationships</strong>, improving <strong>tasks like question answering and natural language inference</strong>.</p>
<h3><strong>Key Note</strong></h3>
<p>* <strong>RoBERTa</strong>, a later model, <strong>removed NSP</strong>, finding it <strong>not essential</strong> for downstream tasks.</p>

<p>Decoder-only models, such as <strong>GPT-3, GPT-4, and PaLM</strong>, are designed for <strong>text generation tasks</strong>. They follow an <strong>autoregressive</strong> approach, predicting the next token based on previously generated tokens. This makes them ideal for tasks like:</p>
<p>* <strong>Storytelling</strong></p>
<p>* <strong>Chatbots</strong></p>
<p>* <strong>Code generation</strong></p>
<p>* <strong>Creative writing</strong></p>
<p><strong>Encoder-only models</strong> (e.g., <strong>BERT</strong>) focus on understanding text rather than generating it.</p>
<p><strong>Encoder-decoder models</strong> (e.g., <strong>T5, BART</strong>) are better for tasks like <strong>translation and summarization</strong> rather than free-form text generation.</p>
