    <strong>
     To enable parallel computation and efficient training
    </strong>
   </p>
   <h3>
    <strong>
     Explanation:
    </strong>
   </h3>
   <p>
    The
    <strong>
     Transformer architecture
    </strong>
    was introduced in the paper *"Attention Is All You Need"* to overcome the limitations of RNNs and LSTMs by enabling
    <strong>
     parallel computation
    </strong>
    through
    <strong>
     self-attention mechanisms
    </strong>
    . This significantly improves
    <strong>
     training efficiency
    </strong>
    and allows models to handle
    <strong>
     long-range dependencies
    </strong>
    more effectively.
   </p>
   <h4>
    <strong>
     Key Advantages of Transformers:
    </strong>
   </h4>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Parallel Processing:
    </strong>
    Unlike RNNs, which process data sequentially, Transformers process entire sequences simultaneously.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Self-Attention Mechanism:
    </strong>
    Captures long-range dependencies without recurrence.
   </p>
   <p>
    *
    <strong>
     Scalability:
    </strong>
    Enables large-scale training, making modern LLMs (like GPT and BERT) feasible.
   </p>
   <p>
    Thus, the Transformer’s main contribution is
    <strong>
     parallel computation and efficient training
    </strong>
    , making it the foundation for
    <strong>
     modern LLMs like GPT, BERT, and T5
    </strong>
    .
